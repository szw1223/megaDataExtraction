My mom got her period when she was 13! Am i ok, or is something wrong and do I need to see a doc?", "question_timestamp": "20080908142830", "followers": 0, "number_of_answers": 5, "categories": ["Health", "Women's Health"], "answers": [{"answer_content": "With the signs you have been having, it seems like you should get your period within the next year.  14 is a little bit late to start your period, but I would say just enjoy the time you have left without it!  Once you get it, you&#39;ll wish you never started it!  Also, just because your mom got her period when she was 13, it doesn&#39;t necessarily affect when you will get yours.  My mom and all of my female relatives got theirs when they were 14 or 15 and I started mine just after I turned 11.  Everyone&#39;s body is different and you&#39;ll start when your body is ready to start.  Good luck!
