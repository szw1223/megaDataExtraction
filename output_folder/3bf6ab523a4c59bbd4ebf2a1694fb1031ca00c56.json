When I was weighed, I was at 109 pounds. That made me feel really fat. But then, the next day I went to the doctors for a check-up I weighed 104 pounds. My clothing wasn&#39;t heavy, I was wearing the same type of outfit I had the day before: a t-shirt and jeans. But I was wondering what could have caused me to drop 5 pounds in one day without doing any exercise or something. Any ideas of what caused it? Thanks.\r\n\r\nAlso, I&#39;m 5&#39;2, if that helps.", "question_timestamp": "20121215154839", "followers": 0, "number_of_answers": 1, "categories": ["Health", "Diet & Fitness"], "answers": [{"answer_content": "Different scales.
