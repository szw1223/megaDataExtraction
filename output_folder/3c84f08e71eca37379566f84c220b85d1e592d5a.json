A big bottle is about $8-9 and can be found at GNC. Make sure you dilute it with water as it is very potent like other oils. You should have very good success with this and should notice HUGE differences within a day.&quot;\r\n\r\nAPPLE CIDER Vinegar AND ALOE VERA FOR ACNE\r\n10/04/2007: Martha from Lawrenceville, GA writes: &quot;I&#39;ve always had trouble with acne -- I could never get my skin completely under control. ACV helped -- taking it internally -- but I still broke out in a monthly cycle. I started using aloe vera gel on my face a few weeks ago, and my skin has cleared up dramatically. I&#39;ve not had one breakout, and my skin is getting to be so pretty! I just use a generic aloe vera gel that I picked up in WalMart.&quot;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOCONUT OIL AND ALOE VERA FOR ACNE\r\n10/03/2007: Jennifer from Kirkland, Washington writes: &quot;I have been using a mixture of coconut oil and aloe vera gel (4:1 ratio) on my face for my acne for only 2 weeks and it has almost completely cleared it up. I have had moderate to severe acne since I was 13 (I am now 37), and have tried everything under the sun to diminish it. Some things have helped more than others, but this is the first time my skin has felt so good and looked so good in almost 25 years\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBest of health to you", "author_link": "https://answers.yahoo.com/activity/questions?show=cd2976d5b06ffd37fee513c0c80c9cefaa", "author_name": "Natural Healer", "best": "true", "dislikes": "0", "likes": 0, "timestamp": "2008-01-12T12:06:15Z"}, {"answer_content": "Don&#39;t just wash your face, treat it. Drink lots of water because hydrating the skin is very important to avoid break outs. If you have alot of acne on your forhead, It may be because you have oily skin. Avoid greasy food, like french fries or other types of fast food. It&#39;s better to wash your face with luke-warm water (to open pores) when you start out, but when your washing the sope out do it with cold water(tighten pores). Pore cleansing as well as moisturizing mask every other day helps me alot too.
