The normal up-down w@nking motion will help, but don&#39;t pull back so hard it hurts or makes things red and sore. \nLook, your foreskin should retract normally with the growth of your penis. If you do not have pain when erect or when w@nking off, you do not &quot;need&quot; to retract. I you just want to, try stretching it &quot;out&quot; instead of back. Do some research on your own. \nGood luck, and have fun.\n\nI borrowed these links from another popular responders here.", "author_link": "https://answers.yahoo.com/activity/questions?show=H8euCqxkaa", "author_name": "TXDiver", "best": "true", "dislikes": "0", "likes": 1, "timestamp": "2011-03-03T15:37:28Z"}, {"answer_content": "Regular stretching is the best way.
