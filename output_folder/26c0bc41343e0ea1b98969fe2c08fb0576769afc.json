The doctor told me to put ice on my face near where the wisdom teeth were. I never put ice, and now I think that&#39;s why they are so swollen. Anyways he told me to eat normal food, but I can&#39;t because its so swollen. Should I just bare the pain and chew down on my missing teeth. Or will it do harm? What is moist heat? I heard it helps the swelling go down, because ice doesn&#39;t work after 36 hours.", "question_timestamp": "20111111052803", "followers": 0, "number_of_answers": 2, "categories": ["Health", "Dental"], "answers": [{"answer_content": "I never ate anything the first 24 hours and never used an ice pack\nDidn&#39;t he give you Tylenol3 or Ibuprophen for pain and swelling?\nNever eat right away.. you might catch food in the openings where the stitches\nare drink things like water, milk, nothing solid\nCall your dentist it should be better in 48 hours not worse!", "author_link": "https://answers.yahoo.com/activity/questions?show=bfc067ab537555ada57edd464a8dfb97aa", "author_name": "Tapestry6", "best": "false", "dislikes": "0", "likes": 0, "timestamp": "2011-11-11T06:03:11Z"}, {"answer_content": "moist heat means that there is humidity in the air.
