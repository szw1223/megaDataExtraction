(Severe Germaphobia Problems)?", "question_content": "It&#39;s been very confusing for me in the past few months on my schemes of living really long and never getting sick.  So here&#39;s what I do:\r\n\r\nWash my hands about 25x a day (after bathroom, before eating, after dirty)\r\nMy hands are bloody dry so I use Shea Butter to cure that.\r\nI have moderate physical activity in the sense that I&#39;m always stressed in school about getting to places quickly so I have to do a lot of running/walking.\r\nI have like 5 friends.\r\n\r\nSo here&#39;s the issue.  I have been a germaphobe for a few months just to not get sick and live longer because my theory is that you live longer if you make your immune system work less and keep it in good condition as much as possible.  But it still hasn&#39;t really done much.  AND I WASH MY HANDS EVERY TIME BEFORE EATING AND AFTER THE BATHROOM!  If I can&#39;t I actually don&#39;t eat!  And I guess I&#39;m good with other clean habits too.  BUT I STILL HAVE GOT 3 COLDS IN THIS TIME PERIOD!  What is the big deal?  Why can&#39;t I find anyway for my plans to work.  \r\n\r\nAlso, people say that this surpresses the immune system.  So I was wondering, if I should stop washing my hands before eating or not because I read a book on the immune system and it said that saliva contains plenty of anitbodies to mark up germs.  \r\n\r\nBut the problem is that every time I try to battle this and say to myself to not wash my hands before eating, I always end up doing it BECAUSE my theory always HAUNTS me.  My theory where I said that try to make the immune system work as less as you can to not wear it out.  \r\n\r\nSo should I stop or should I continue?\r\n\r\nMy parents said to only do it during sickness seasons.\r\n\r\nAnd I it is kind of getting boring to wash my hands before eating but then again my theory and that I want to live for a long time and never get sick gets in the way.\r\n\r\nWHAT DO I DO?", "question_timestamp": "20111209150034", "followers": 0, "number_of_answers": 1, "categories": ["Health", "Diseases & Conditions", "Infectious Diseases"], "answers": [{"answer_content": "Well biologically just because your immune system is healthy doesn&#39;t mean that you won&#39;t die early or before 100 years of age. You should wash your hands before and after you eat/go to the restroom, or have contact with dirty surfaces. 25 times a day may be a little excessive...   Being a germaphobe is pointless. Look up how much bacteria there is on just your skin and you&#39;ll see. Let alone the mouth and other organs. There are good germs and bad germs. You will get sick even though you do all the excessive things you do. It just happens.
