With a virus, u will have that, plus body aches, fever, nausea, light headedness and will basically feel like u have been run over by a truck!  Docs told me last week when i had the flu to drink water if u are vomiting.  if u are keeping water down, u can go to clear fluids like 7 up or ginger ale and crackers.  stay with this diet for a day before u try anything heavier.  Dont worry about eating if u have vomiting or the runs.  just drink water.  if u cant keep anything down, including tylenol or advil for your fever for 24 hours, seek medical attention, because its really easy to get dehydrated.  Once u are dehydrated, u cant get better on your own.  Good luck and feel better soon :)", "author_link": "https://answers.yahoo.com/activity/questions?show=juXQJJrXaa", "author_name": "hrider@ymail.com", "best": "true", "dislikes": "0", "likes": 1, "timestamp": "2009-05-26T18:49:46Z"}, {"answer_content": "Food poisoning.
