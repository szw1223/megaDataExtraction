Eating healthy everyday with loads of veggies and some fruits, whole grains and protein is the best way to stay healthy.\r\n\r\nTry this:\r\nEat brown rice, veggies and baked fish for dinner.\r\nOatmeal for breakfast with fruit in it. \r\nDrink fruit smoothies during the day for a snack. Try to eat protein at every meal...for breakfast with the oatmeal, eat a scrambled egg white or a hard boiled egg.\r\nEat a salad or chicken/turkey sandwich on whole wheat for lunch. Use olive oil and vinegar dressing...no saucy dressings.\r\nDrink water only.\r\nNever eat white or processed foods.\r\nTry baked sweet potatoes...mmm... Eat spinach salads, not plain lettuce and add all the veggies you want to it. Try red wine vinegar...a few splashes and a little drizzle of olive oil.\r\nIf you want a crunchy snack, cut up a cucumber and put in lite Italian dressing or better yet, half cold water and half white vinegar. I mix mine with some cherry tomatoes too...\r\n\r\nA good smoothie needs a good blender, so make sure you have one, cut up 1 banana, some blueberries (about 10-15) and strawberries (about 5), a cup or so of skim milk, a sprinkle of flax seed (buy a container of it and keep in fridge), a scoop of vanilla protein powder and blend it up, add a bit of crushed ice and you&#39;ve got a good smoothie. You can add any kind of fruit...I cut up peaches sometimes too or frozen cherries. \r\n\r\nTry reverse crunches, where you lift your legs up and out. Go to SELF.com for good tips...I love their workouts. Walk or run a lot and \r\nuse a stability ball for crunches.", "author_link": "not found", "author_name": "\u262eM\u03b5l\u03b1ni\u03b5\u01b8\u0335\u0321\u04dc\u0335\u0304\u0328\u01b7\u00b8\u00b8.\u2022*\u00b4`\u262e\u2661\u262e\u2661\u262e\u262e\u2661\u262e", "best": "true", "dislikes": "0", "likes": 0, "timestamp": "2009-07-26T16:06:35Z"}, {"answer_content": "Men are supposed to have 2,500 a day; women are supposed to have 2,000. \r\n\r\nRather than divide this between 3 meals, include a mid-morning healthy snack, as well as something in the afternoon.
