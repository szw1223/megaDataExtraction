I tried massage therapy and physical therapy and could not take medication \nI went to the chiropractor and the pain was instantly relieved. My hips and lower back were out of alignment because I had carried twins the year before. On occasion a Doctor of Osteopathy (DO) can also work but they usually only work on one joint at a time - the chiropractor will do your whole back which works faster. Anyone who does not believe in chiropractors will tell you they are quacks - don&#39;t listen. \nI don&#39;t necessarily believe that chiropractors can cure things like diabetes but they can definitely relieve some types of back pain especially if a pinched nerve is involved which is usually the cause of sciatica.", "author_link": "not found", "author_name": "Anonymous", "best": "false", "dislikes": "0", "likes": 0, "timestamp": "2014-10-29T21:52:46Z"}, {"answer_content": "My GP sent me to hospital with severe chest pain numbness in left arm and high B/P the A/E dept. made sit for nearly 5 hours without seeing a consultant then I could not sit anymore had to go home so I can rest in my bed with the pain. though the pain is not as severe now as I am taking painkillers but still have the pain in my chest and I am worried I am 70 and this is the first time I experienced this I do not smoke or drink.
