The itching was unbearable, so unbearable that I couldn&#39;t sleep, I was very sore and had small cuts from itching too much... I put the yoghurt on the outside and inside of my vagina and left it for 45 minutes, I then had a bath to wash it off and repeated the same thing the next day. My symptoms have now disappeared, I no longer have white clumpy discharge, I am not itchy in the slightest, not sore and my small cuts are healing, I am no longer red down there... Has my yeast infection gone or is it going? Or will the problem still be there? It feels normal down there again but I&#39;ve read yoghurt doesn&#39;t help...
