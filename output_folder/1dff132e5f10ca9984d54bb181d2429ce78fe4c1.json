Here is how it works. No one teaches the animal what to eat and what not to eat. He knows instinctively what to eat. Humans also have the same instinct. The way it works is just eat whatever tastes good and that will be healthy for you and non-fattening. That is why a baby tastes everything. So again whatever tastes good, is good for you. This is why you will spit out spoiled milk.\r\n\r\nBut wait!!! Man has the technology to create rat poison. It tastes like healthy food (good taste) but kills the rat. So man has done that to you. Note- any food unaltered by man (uncooked) that tastes good, is good for you.  So if you are stranded in the woods, that is how you  know what to eat (cooking changes that). So man has created fake fruit. It tastes like fruit that exists in nature but it is terrrible for health, addictive and fattening called sweets.\r\n\r\nSo it is natural  to like real sweets called fruit, like a baby does, but they have fooled you just the rat. But they do not want to kill you. They want you to become obese so you will buy lots of their foods. This is called GOOD BUSINESS. Remember the above (not on site) and see site below to re-learn how to eat so you can be thin and fit for life.\r\n\r\nhttp://phifoundation.org", "author_link": "not found", "author_name": "Anonymous", "best": "true", "dislikes": "0", "likes": 0, "timestamp": "2006-08-14T16:23:08Z"}, {"answer_content": "A)rule out pregnancy test\r\nB) small one at home driving you nuts?\r\nC)  Husband, boyfriend,,driving you crazy?\r\nD) or depressed.\r\nFirst rule out a and b.

Like 2/3 of all modern Americans, you have a serious sugar addicion. The massive amounts of sugar which you are consuming are actually &quot;leaching&quot; desparately needed vitamins and minerals from your body, causing various &quot;cravings&quot; which invariably lead to more and more sugar.\r\n\r\nThe body requires some amount of sugar for energy. True, but it has to come from natural fruits, vegetables, grains, milk, dates, raisins, etc. Getting this energy from sugar is nothing short of suicidal because it is more damaging to health than all other narcotics combined, writes Amar Chandel\r\n\r\nRefined sugar is also lethal because it provides only that which nutritionists describe as &quot;empty&quot; or &quot;naked&quot; calories. It lacks the natural minerals which are present in sugar beet or cane. In addition, sugar drains and leaches the body of precious vitamins and minerals through the demand that digestion, detoxification and elimination make upon one\u2019s entire system.\r\n\r\nDr David Reuben, author of Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Nutrition, says: &quot;White refined sugar is not a food. It is a pure chemical extracted from plant sources, purer in fact than cocaine, which it resembles in many ways&quot;. It is actually a &quot;poison.&quot;\r\n\r\nHeroin and sugar are prepared through similar processes of refinement. In producing heroin, the opium is first extracted from the poppy. The opium is then refined into morphine. The chemists then work on morphine and further refine it into heroin.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, sugar is first pressed as a juice from cane (or beet) and refined into molasses. Then it is refined into brown sugar, and finally into white crystalline chemical, which is alien to the human system. The body is not suited to accommodate this level of refinement. When you consume simple sugars, they are passed quickly into the blood stream. Blood sugar levels skyrocket, and you experience a lift in energy. But that feeling of increased energy and mental alertness is very temporary. Sugar highs lead to sugar crashes and the body cries out for more sugar.\r\n\r\nVery often we don\u2019t even know we are taking sugar. Colas, ketchups, packaged juices, prepared foods, salad dressings and even medicines and toothpastes are packed with sugar. Most of the commercial fruit juices are full of the sweet poison. Soft drinks contain up to 11 teaspoons of sugar each.\r\n\r\nI recommend the following, if you really want to lose weight as well as live a longer and healthier life:", "author_link": "not found", "author_name": "Anonymous", "best": "false", "dislikes": "0", "likes": 0, "timestamp": "2006-08-14T17:08:03Z"}, {"answer_content": "easily no longer!! and that i think of they might call it someting eilke...
