For one month, i have basically been doing the same exercises for each body part. For example on chest days i do bench press, chess press, chest fly and etc. About every 2 weeks I increase the weight on each exercise. Is it necassery for me to do completetly different excercises after lets say 1 month to stop my results from stopping, or is changing the weight and the order i do the excersices enough.\r\nPlease answer", "question_timestamp": "20100901235130", "followers": 0, "number_of_answers": 3, "categories": ["Health", "Diet & Fitness"], "answers": [{"answer_content": "You&#39;re on the right track!\r\n\r\nYou&#39;ve probably heard common reasons why people say you need to change up your exercises.\r\n\r\nTo confuse/shock the muscle: This is the most popular reason for changing exercises. You cannot confuse or shock a muscle, period. It is physiologically impossible.\r\n\r\nMuscles are passive tissues that contract when told to do so. It doesn\u2019t have a brain of its own to get confused.  It is as stupid as saying if you pull an elastic band in a different angle you confuse and shock the band.\r\n\r\nMuscle Magazines said so: Most of the changing exercises concept come from muscle magazines (for example the Weider muscle Confusion Principle).\r\n\r\n    * Most models are genetically gifted and use \u201creal\u201d supplements. Unlike naturals, they can do whatever they want and still grow.\r\n\r\n    * They need to put out a magazine every month. New exercise pictures are a great way to fill magazine pages every month.\r\n\r\nWhy you should NOT change exercises too often?\r\n\r\nLearning Curve: Every exercise has a learning curve called Neural Changes or Adaptations (nervous system adaptations). It is just like learning to ride a bike. You get better at whatever you do with practice.\r\n\r\nThis learning period take a few weeks or a few months depending on the exercise &amp; the skill level.\r\n\r\nMuscle Increase: The muscle increase is minimal during the time when body learns to do a new exercise. Muscle increases largely come after the neural changes plateau.\r\n\r\nSo if you keep on changing exercises every 4 or 6 weeks, the body never gets a chance to increase the muscle involved in that particular exercise. By the time your learning curve (or neural adaptations) plateaus, you unfortunately jumped onto a different exercise.\r\n\r\nStrength Increase: The strength increase you experience in the learning period is mainly improvement in skill or neural adaptations than due to muscle growth. This disappear once you stop doing that particular exercise.\r\n\r\nRecommendations\r\n\r\n    * Keep 2-3 basic exercises for each body part, like incline bench press, dumbbell press for chest and rotate them. This way you don\u2019t have to stick with one exercise.\r\n\r\n    * You can change single joint exercises like dumbbell curls, chest flyes and so on. The neural adaptations are minimal for single joint exercises.\r\n\r\n    * If you hit a plateau in an exercise, it is time to re-analyze your program and diet and not to change the exercise to \u201cshock\u201d your muscles..", "author_link": "not found", "author_name": "?", "best": "false", "dislikes": "0", "likes": 1, "timestamp": "2010-09-01T23:53:42Z"}, {"answer_content": "The best rep range for hypertrophy is 8-12 reps, so if your goal is to gain mass, adjust your weight so you&#39;re doing reps in that range.\r\n\r\nYou don&#39;t need to change your exercises often, but sooner or later you might find you stop making a bit of progress, that means it&#39;s time to do a few things.\r\n\r\n1.
