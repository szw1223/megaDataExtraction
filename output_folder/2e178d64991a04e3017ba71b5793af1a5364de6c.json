Sometimes this is just the consequence of a deep filling, and it should subside within a week.\r\n2. If it is a white (composite) filling, then these are much more likely to give post-op pain than silver fillings. This is because they shrink (1-4%) upon setting, and can pull away from the floor or sides of the cavity. They need much more careful placement than amalgams to work properly.\r\nIf the pain continues for another couple of days, or if it is worsening, then ask to have the white filling replaced with an amalgam. It can also be helpful to swab the cavity floor with a corticosteroid eyewash before placing the lining.\r\nSometimes you just are unlucky, and the decay was so deep that the &quot;nerve&quot; in the tooth cannot recover.
