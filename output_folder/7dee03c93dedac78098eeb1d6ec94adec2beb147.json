Spacers in my mouth!?", "question_content": "Okay, yesterday I went in to the orthodontist office and got the spacers around 11. The woman who put them in said I should eat lunch right away because it would start to get really painful. I was on my way to a restaurant when I realized they weren&#39;t in. I went back and the orthodontist told me that I had managed to chew right through the rubber on 5 out of the 8 in my mouth. I have very tight back teeth so it was hard to put the rubber ones back in, so I had to put 2 metal ones in. One on the lower left side of my mouth and one on the upper right. I had no pain for the next few hours. I was actually more annoyed on how it felt like something was stuck in my teeth and I had to force myself not to pick at it. However, as the night started to wear on it got sorer and sorer. I had already taken 5 ibuprofen when I noticed the pain. I got some ice cream and that helped, then I had some dinner and another ice cream on the way home. Later in the night pain was horrible so I took a tylenol and that did nothing! The pain was only on the left side of my mouth and the right was perfectly fine. Now today holy crap. It literally feels like a million needles are being stabbed into every part of my mouth all at once. I could barely eat my scrambled eggs. I had ice cream and that helped for like a second. I can&#39;t even concentrate with this awful pain! \r\n\r\nPlease, I&#39;m begging for any suggestions on how to soothe my mouth. Every little movement hurts with it and even when I&#39;m not moving my mouth there&#39;s an ache. I&#39;ve already tried using my waterpik and rinsing with salt water. Please Please Please help! I&#39;m desperate!", "question_timestamp": "20121212070345", "followers": 0, "number_of_answers": 2, "categories": ["Health", "Dental"], "answers": [{"answer_content": "Ugh!! i know how you feel. i had to wear spacers for 2 weeks xP my advice is to take alternating painkillers (ibuprofen AND acetaminophen both can be taken at the same time, just watch your doses) and, if you start to feel a little better, DON&#39;T EAT REGULAR FOOD!!!! it will just make your mouth ache a whole lot more when the painkillers wear off. Really, all you can do is eat soft and/or cold foods: i recommend pudding, jello, mashed potatoes, oatmeal, ice cream, and box macaroni and cheese(that you won&#39;t have to chew). Those were my staples when i had my spacers. Also, when you&#39;re just sitting or not doing any talking, work, etc. try as much as possible to keep your mouth slightly ajar, and don&#39;t let your teeth touch each other! it hurts like a mother, believe me. xP\n\nGood luck!!
