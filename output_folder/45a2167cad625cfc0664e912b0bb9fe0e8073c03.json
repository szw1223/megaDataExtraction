You didn&#39;t say if she was petit or grand mal..... either way, the important thing is to stay calm and not freak out, and to prevent anybody else nearby from over-reacting as well.  Her mom probably knows any advance warning signs... you could, with your friend&#39;s permission, ask her.\r\n\r\nWhat would you like to learn &quot;about health&quot;??  Just a generally healthy lifestyle? I post some tips below: a summary i made up. I&#39;ll check back later to see if you&#39;ve added any details. These general guidelines would apply to folks with epiliepsy as well.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, here are some tips for an overall healthy lifestyle, based upon my knowledge of such matters:\r\n\r\n1) Build physical activity into your life-style: cycling and walking are great ways to get around whenever possible, swimming is a fun, all-round exercise, sports are also excellent and more fun than just \u201cexercising\u201d\u2026. of course you can also go to the gym, but don\u2019t fall into the trap of depending upon gym time and activities to get enough exercise and physical activity!!\r\n\r\n2) Cut out snacking\u2026.. period. Eat at regular intervals: this is much healthier for your body, and you\u2019d be surprised at how many calories snacks can add up to!!\r\n\r\n3) Cut out junk foods \u2013 or at least minimize them. They add lots of calories but almost no nutrition. Soda pop is a big culprit, but pizza, white bread (yes, it\u2019s a junk food \u2013 the vitamins they add to white flour are nutritionally almost useless), chips, burgers, etc.\r\n\r\n4) Maximize the fruit, veggies, nuts and other healthy categories in your diet. Dark green veggies are powerhouses of nutrition.\r\n\r\n5) Get enough sleep: this is important to losing weight and staying healthy all-round: when you don\u2019t get enough sleep, your energy levels are low and you\u2019ll be less likely to get out and do things: in short a sleep-starved person is often a lazy one!! Besides, the old excuse that you don\u2019t have time for sufficient sleep (about 8 hours for most teens) is a false one: if you sleep well, you\u2019ll be much more energetic and alert and you\u2019ll get more things done in less time than you would if you skimp on sleep in order to \u201csave time\u201d!! Darkness and quiet are important for getting high-quality sleep. Keep your room cool at night, don\u2019t hide your head under the covers (where you\u2019re breathing in what you just breathed out\u2026.), and be sure to drink enough before you go to bed. A good shower followed by a nice shot of cold water also helps you to get to sleep!!\r\n\r\n6) Drink plenty of water \u2013 more than you normally would: this will give you more energy, and will help your body function more efficiently overall. The color of your pee will tell you if you are drinking enough: it should be almost clear: if it is distinctly yellow you are not properly hydrated and need some more water. Sure you\u2019ll go to the bathroom more often, but the increase in energy levels and the decrease in tension levels will make it more than worthwhile, trust me!!!\r\n\r\n7) Eat a good breakfast, and a light supper. Breakfast gives you energy for the morning, and revs up your metabolism for the day. Without a proper breakfast you will be sluggish and not as energetic or alert. Breakfast foods should be ones which digest easily \u2013 this means bacon, hash browns and sausages are **out**, while whole grains and tasty fruit are **in**!! Yougurt makes a good breakfast food too\u2026. // A light supper will mean you don\u2019t go to bed on a full stomach: a practice which is bad for your health since it impairs the quality of your sleep.\r\n\r\n8) STRETCH properly and thoroughly at four times: 1) After a bit of a warmup, so you are not stretching cold muscles, 2) After exercise session,s and 3) carefully, just before going to bed, so you won\u2019t be nearly as sore the next day. (and 4) whenever any of your muscles are tight.) // Proper stretching has a lot of benefits, including just feeling more relaxed in general, which is why i included it here. I recommend having a couple of sessions with a phys-ed teacher or trainer in a gym, and asking them to teach you about the basics of proper stretching.\r\n\r\n9) LAUGHTER!! Always one of the very best medicines for whatever ails you (except perhaps broken ribs, lol!). Always try to maintain your sense of humor in good repair: it is one of the best assets you can have, in this often stress-filled and confusing world :-=).\r\n\r\n10) Spend time in &quot;natural&quot; areas whenever you can: parks, woods and fields - anywhere that nature is dominant over human activities and structures. You&#39;ll be surprised at how much better this can make you feel!!\r\n\r\nWishing you all the best!!\r\nSource(s):\r\n40 years of studying and practicing such matters.", "author_link": "not found", "author_name": "thecanadianone", "best": "true", "dislikes": "0", "likes": 0, "timestamp": "2012-07-03T15:31:19Z"}], "authorInfor": "none", "last_updata_data": "now"}
