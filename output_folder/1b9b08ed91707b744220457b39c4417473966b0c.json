I was sitting down on a couch talking to a couple of friends when she walked into my view. She was standing side on to me with a white wall behind her and I noticed that her butt sticks out. Her back and her legs are in a line sort of but when it comes to her butt it curves out a lot. Should it not be a straight line down from her back to her legs? Is she swollen up and dying? Please help, I haven&#39;t had the nerve to tell her about it yet in case it worries her....", "question_timestamp": "20121116062028", "followers": 0, "number_of_answers": 1, "categories": ["Health", "Women's Health"], "answers": [{"answer_content": "bum sex\n\nit curves out a lot, \n-- big *** sex! :) haha", "author_link": "not found", "author_name": "Ada Ava", "best": "true", "dislikes": "0", "likes": 0, "timestamp": "2012-11-16T06:20:58Z"}], "authorInfor": "none", "last_updata_data": "now"}
