I would imagine this is different for most people.  My advice is to continue changing up your routine as it sounds like you are doing.  Once you reach your plateau, to trick your body, if you&#39;re doing cardio, either go longer or just change it up with extra intervals, etc.  Strength training I would suggest some new moves to charge your metabolism back up.  Also, not sure if you are doing cardio and strength, but if you are and depending on time restraints, if you do cardio in the a.m. and strength in the p.m., you will double your metabolism boost.  And of course, you can always add a new discipline into your routine such as yoga, tai-chi, anything to put your body into thinking &quot;hey, this is different, I need to get back to work&quot;", "author_link": "https://answers.yahoo.com/activity/questions?show=ryXZnkndaa", "author_name": "Roundtree Cumberbatch", "best": "false", "dislikes": "0", "likes": 0, "timestamp": "2008-02-10T16:10:39Z"}, {"answer_content": "your muscles will not grow if THE SAME muscles are targeted, such as military pushups everyday for a month. but as long as you target different muscles every day, your body will get shocked. try to switch up the excercises every week. for example, if Monday you do military pushups, tuesday, you do situps, wednesday, you do bench press, thursday, you do curls, and friday you work with dumbells, then the next week, do situps on monday, pushups on tuesday, dumbells on wednesday, curls on thursday, and bench press on friday.... you understand what I&#39;m saying?", "author_link": "none", "author_name": "Anonymous", "best": "false", "dislikes": "0", "likes": 1, "timestamp": "2008-02-10T16:10:08Z"}, {"answer_content": "I would say until the resistance is no longer enough to make you tired.
