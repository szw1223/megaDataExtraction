Also, if you provide less caloric sources for the mitochondria to convert to ATP (via the Krebs cycle, the body will tap into its fat stores to balance the deficit.  This is the normal way to lose fat.  \r\n\r\nIn addition, the healthy way to lose fat involves creating this calorie shortage while providing enough proteins, carbs, and essential fatty acids to keep the  body from breaking down muscle tissue (starvation).  \r\n\r\nPersonally, I would really like it if Bryan posted the link to his website because I would find it to be very informative for all of us and I would not consider it to be spam.\r\n\r\nAnyway, here is a link to more info about the subject:\r\nhttp://www.spartafit.com/articles/energy%20systems.php", "author_link": "https://answers.yahoo.com/activity/questions?show=tGYtM9OCaa", "author_name": "fitman", "best": "false", "dislikes": "1", "likes": 0, "timestamp": "2007-05-15T05:05:08Z"}, {"answer_content": "Ah. I did an indepth study on my website (which I won&#39;t post for fear of spam) that discussed the small cellular process of burning fat.\r\n\r\nThe cells have what&#39;s called &quot;mitochondria&quot; that convert stored or eaten energy (fat, carbs, and protein) into ATP, the body&#39;s main and quickest energy source - kind of like an &quot;energy adapter&quot;.\r\n\r\nThe mitochondria actually lives in living cells in the body, and the more used the living cell is (like muscle, or organ tissue) the more mitochondria actually have in the body.\r\n\r\nThe more of these &quot;powerhouse&quot; organelles, as most call them, the better the body is at converting fat into energy. This is why most people say that the more muscle you have, the faster your metabolism is - because your muscle has some of the most mitochondria in the body.\r\n\r\nThe mitochondria convert fats, carbs, and sometimes protein into ATP, which is the broken to kind of perform a fueling type effect. When your cells need energy, this process continues. When your cells need a lot of energy (like with exercise, or vigorous activity) these mitochondria work overtime to produce even more energy, thus, burning more fat.\r\n\r\n;) I hope that shared a little bit of what goes on inside the body when you lose weight.
