I don&#39;t think it&#39;s anything serious, but thought I&#39;d better make sure.\r\n\r\nFrom time to time, when I get an erection (mostly when visually stimulated or during sleep, not by touch), my penis erects in a non-uniform way; the lower half (scrotum side) stays small and non-erect while the upper half (glans side) becomes fully erect. (You could say some &quot;necking&quot; occurs in the base or middle) There&#39;s no pain or anything, and the problem can be solved by some rubbing (to get the blood to flow, I guess).\r\n\r\nCan anyone tell me what the cause of this could be? Could it have anything to do with blood pressure or circulation?\r\n\r\nI also suffer from hemorrhoids, say, once or twice a month. Could these be related in any way?\r\n\r\nThanks!", "question_timestamp": "20130325032732", "followers": 0, "number_of_answers": 1, "categories": ["Health", "Men's Health"], "answers": [{"answer_content": "You will need to consult with urologist to determine why this is happening, but it&#39;s good that you notice something isn&#39;t quite right and can do something about it promptly rather than let it develop into a serious concern.There are other aspects that can be examined such as current (blood) lab values and other possible causes.", "author_link": "https://answers.yahoo.com/activity/questions?show=VVsfXGZqaa", "author_name": "Glen", "best": "true", "dislikes": "0", "likes": 0, "timestamp": "2013-03-25T04:16:31Z"}], "authorInfor": "none", "last_updata_data": "now"}
