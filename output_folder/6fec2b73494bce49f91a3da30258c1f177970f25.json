I have expressed to him on plenty of occasions that i really dont want there to be strippers there.  I think it should be a guys.night out of drinking and doing the normal things they do,  video games,  pool,  card games.... not half naked girls dancing on my soon to be husband.  He just gets mad and says that he wouldnt be planning it and hw doesnt want to look like he doesnt want his friends to have fun. Hes the type of person that cant say no to his friends even if its something he doesnt want to do. But i believe that its something he does want there and that if he really didnt want a strippwr there that hed tell them no and if a girl showed up that hed at least tell her no.  Hes bad at dealing with pressure from others.\r\n\r\nI dont believe he would cheat on me but how do i stop worrying about this and comparing myself to this imaginary stripper / every other girl that i see.  It makes me physically sick.  I want to be able to day dream about our wedding and engagement and how itll all play out but all i think about is the night hes going to spend out with his friends and how there will most likley be a naked girl dancing on top of him and all his friends will just be sitting and watching and i juat feel helpless and like im overreacting. Maybe its the pregnancy hormones nd me feeling insecure about my body at the moment but ita been really bad the past few days.  Please any advice on how to stop this irrational fear.  \r\n\r\nI do trust and love my boyfriend with all my heart.  Hes been cheated on before and hed never cheat on me.", "question_timestamp": "20121207072128", "followers": 0, "number_of_answers": 3, "categories": ["Health", "Women's Health"], "answers": [{"answer_content": "When any person gets into a situation where they want something very badly but they have no control over it, that is when they start feeling the way you do right now. Because you cannot control what your boyfriend thinks or what any of his friends think or do, you are feeling very out of control about something that is very important to you. What helps is to think of what you can control. You can tell your boyfriend how you feel about it, which you have done. You can decide what you will do about it if it does happen and let him know what it is. Just make sure it is something you really will do, not just an empty threat. If you know that nothing is going to change except your own self esteem, let him know that too. You stated that he has a hard time standing up to the pressure of  his friends, and because you can&#39;t change him, you have to accept him the way he is. (One of those things you can&#39;t control. :) ) If it was me, I&#39;d go to the guy who is in charge of making the party happen, probably his best friend, and talk to him about your concerns. Ask him to please not bring in girls to the party. Let him know it is something you do not feel comfortable with. But I would not get into a power struggle with your boyfriend or his friends because that is trying to control what you can&#39;t control. Congratulations on your new baby!
