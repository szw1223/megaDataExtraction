The ear ache, sore throat and headache may all be related to sinus drainage/infection.  The muscle soreness and fatigue are probably side effects of the fever.  It took about 10 days for me to get past what I had.\r\n\r\nYou can alternate between Tylenol and ibuprofen; take one then take the other two hours later, alternating back and forth between the two in two hour intervals.  \r\n\r\nThe ear ache is probably your best indicator as to whether you are getting better or worse.  If it lasts more than a couple of days or becomes unbearable, then you should see a doctor and get a prescription for it.  Otherwise, like most viruses, it will just have to run its course.", "author_link": "https://answers.yahoo.com/activity/questions?show=FQ4UF6Cwaa", "author_name": "Greg H", "best": "false", "dislikes": "0", "likes": 0, "timestamp": "2007-02-10T23:04:41Z"}, {"answer_content": "My Fiance has the same thing and has for a couple of days now and had a fever of 101 and he has been drinking lots of fluids, napping alot, eating soup and taking Benylin pills for cold and flu it works wonders and he feels much better today.
