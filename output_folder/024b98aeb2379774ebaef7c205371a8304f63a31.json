After reading of the possible causes i then am worried to sleep fearing i will wake up with no vision! Please help me, i dont see these flashes in the day as far as i know. Ive heard the theory that it is your eyes releasing light if they have taken in alot over the day? it happened last night for the first time in a few weeks and i had spent the whole morning inside in the dark and then when i went outside, the harsh sunlight was affecting my eyes, but soon they were back to normal. I also spent a good 5 hours (9pm-2am) on the computer. could this be the cause? I have had floaters in my eyes for a good while and so i think they are unrelated. Also, the reason i mention melonoma is because i am blue eyed, fair skinned, from north europe and recently had sun burn. (can you tell im a hypoconriac? haha) Thanks for your answers", "question_timestamp": "20110829130306", "followers": 0, "number_of_answers": 4, "categories": ["Health", "Optical"], "answers": [{"answer_content": "It could just be Hypnagogia.
