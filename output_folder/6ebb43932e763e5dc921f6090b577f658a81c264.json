Read about the frenulum on the internet.  It is the connective tissue that anchors the foreskin to the glans from the &#39;eye&#39; as you called it.  It is super sensitive connective tissue that just needs to be stretched more.  I have posted some links below with some foreskin stretches that will work.  The frenulum is a bit more elastic than the foreskin but you can use the same principals.  Work the stretches into the daily shower routine and let the warm water loosen and relax the skin before you begin to stretch.\r\nJust be gentle with it for the next week or it will open up again and bleed.  Try to keep the area clean, but do not scrub with soap.  This area is cleaner than we give it credit for.  You shower and wash, and then cover it with two layers of clean clothes.  You only take it out to urinate.  How could it get dirty?  Urine is sterile.  Your hands come in more contact with dirt than your genitals do, so do not worry about infections.  Just give it enough time to heal and you will be fine.\r\nAnother method of stretching a tight frenulum is when masturbating, grip the skin so there is a slight [SLIGHT] tug on the down stroke.  The whole process will take up to a month to stretch it out, but it will be well worth the time and effort.  If you do see a doctor, do not let them even breathe the word&quot; circumcision.  It is the last thing you need.  Be very firm and tell them it is not an option.  Find a new doctor if need be.\r\nGo to:  www.norm.org  and read about the reason and function of the foreskin.  You will see how very fortunate you are to still have yours, and how misguided are those who promote circumcision.\r\nGood luck with this.\r\nMithras", "author_link": "none", "author_name": "Anonymous", "best": "true", "dislikes": "0", "likes": 0, "timestamp": "2009-12-01T05:53:27Z"}, {"answer_content": "I&#39;m a girl, so I don&#39;t know exactly what it&#39;s like but I had a slight accident last year in terms of well being &#39;torn&#39; and I used antiseptic cream and after a week it started healing properly. I would just suggest carrying on with the cream and if after a week it hasn&#39;t started improving at all then take a trip to your doctor.
