More accurate than its predecessors, electro-chemical meters can still be off by 10 to 15 percent of actual glucose numbers. \r\n\r\nBlood glucose monitors contain biosensors and are designed to keep track of the level of sugars in the blood. This is the only substance these machines are programmed to read. To do this, a small amount of blood must be tested at least once daily by sticking a finger and squeezing the blood onto a test strip, which is then inserted into the machine. The monitor then takes the color of the strip and translates it to a blood glucose reading. There are also insulin pumps that can determine how much insulin you already have in your system, so that you don&#39;t accidentally give yourself too much. \r\n\r\nPeople who control their diabetes with insulin may need to check their blood sugar levels more than once a day. These readings can be stored within the tiny computer chip inside the monitor so that the person doing the testing can easily keep track of his or her blood sugar levels for several days in a row. This helps in controlling the &#39;teeter-totter&#39; effect that is so common in the treatment of diabetes. \r\n\r\nCheck out http://teststripnetwork.com/default.aspx They collect unused test strips for diabetics that can\u2019t afford them.

It&#39;s kinda like wearing an insulin pump without the tubing. The sensor is inserted into your abdomen like the pump cannula and stays there for 3 days at a time. It then sends signals to the machine (about the size of a large cell phone) that has to stay near you (10 feet?) every 15 minutes. It&#39;s not the same as a blood glucose level, so you have to check it against a glucometer every so often.", "author_link": "https://answers.yahoo.com/activity/questions?show=uV2ilBivaa", "author_name": "?", "best": "false", "dislikes": "0", "likes": 0, "timestamp": "2016-03-13T08:03:34Z"}, {"answer_content": "I&#39;m a 45 year old woman and was recently diagnosed as being a borderline diabetic.
