Just be sure to take your pill on time tomorrow. Remember also that condoms are not fool proof so if you&#39;re worried about pregnancy then I would suggest abstinence until you take your next pill. Also if I&#39;m not mistaken you should give it 24 hrs after you take your next pill to ensure full protection.
