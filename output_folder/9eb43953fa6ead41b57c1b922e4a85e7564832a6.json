Although it is a natural function, emetophobes fear this reaction in many cases it is the fear that it can happen without warning and at any time day or night. This can lead to panic attacks and a high level of anxiety in emetophobes, however, the vast majority of emetophobes are not sick for many many years, some are never sick.\r\n\r\nVomiting can be triggered by smells, sounds, tastes and problems with food. The process of vomiting in very complex and involves many different signals from different parts of the body. Within your brain there is a vomit control centre that sends signals to various parts of the body . Vomiting is a forceful action accomplished by a fierce, downward contraction of the diaphragm. At the same time, the abdominal muscles tighten against a relaxed stomach with an open sphincter. The contents of the stomach are propelled up and out.\r\n\r\nVomiting is a complex, coordinated reflex orchestrated by the vomiting center of the brain. It responds to signals coming from:\r\n\r\nThe mouth, stomach, and intestines \r\nThe bloodstream, which may contain medicines or infections \r\nThe balancing systems in the ear (motion sickness) \r\nThe brain itself, including unsettling sights, smells, or thoughts \r\nAn amazing variety of stimuli can trigger vomiting, from migraines to kidney stones. \r\nSometimes, just seeing/hearing someone else vomit will start you vomiting, it&#39;s your body&#39;s effort to protect you from possible exposure to the same danger. \r\nThere are a vast number of reasons why we may vomit some of these are listed below;\r\n\r\nEating disorders (anorexia and bulimia) \r\nFood poisoning/allergies \r\nMotion sickness (car sickness, seasickness) \r\nVertigo (the sensation that the room is spinning around) \r\nHead injuries (such as a concussion or bleeding injury) \r\nGallbladder disease or appendicitis \r\nMigraine (a severe form of headache) \r\nBrain infections (such as meningitis) \r\nHydrocephalus (too much fluid in the brain) \r\nViral infections \r\nMedications \r\nMorning sickness during pregnancy \r\nBrain tumors \r\nChemotherapy in cancer patients \r\nBulimia \r\nAlcoholism \r\n\r\nWhat Is Vomit/Nausea?\r\nVomiting and nausea are not illnesses but common complaints that go along with many diseases and conditions. The problems with nausea and vomiting are related to the cause. Nausea and vomiting from motion sickness or seasickness or cancer therapy can result in loss of water and electrolytes, which can lead to dehydration. Vomiting and nausea known as morning sickness may occur during pregnancy. \r\n\r\nNausea, the unmistakable, unpleasant, queasy feeling in your throat or stomach that may result in vomiting, is a message sent by your brain. It tells you that something isn&#39;t right. \r\nVomiting means emptying your stomach by a strong gag and retch that leads to throwing up. The stomach&#39;s contents are forcefully expelled through the mouth. Vomiting can come in waves as the natural movement (known as peristalses) is reversed, and involuntary contractions in the walls of your stomach and esophagus force the stomach contents out. Sometimes coughing or spitting up mucus from the lungs is confused with vomiting. You can only vomit from the stomach. \r\nRetching is the movement of the stomach and esophagus without vomiting. Sometimes this is called the dry heaves. Most people experiencing the dry heaves would rather just throw up and &quot;get it over with.&quot;", "author_link": "https://answers.yahoo.com/activity/questions?show=r0LZ8kslaa", "author_name": "futuredoc", "best": "true", "dislikes": "0", "likes": 0, "timestamp": "2007-06-03T20:21:33Z"}, {"answer_content": "Vomiting may be due to a large number of causes, and protracted vomiting has a long differential diagnosis.\r\n\r\nDigestive tract\r\n\r\nCauses in the digestive tract:\r\n\r\n    * Gastritis (inflammation of the gastric wall, usually by viruses)\r\n    * Pyloric stenosis (in babies - this typically causes a very forceful &quot;projectile vomiting&quot; and is an indication for urgent surgery)\r\n    * Bowel obstruction\r\n    * Acute abdomen and/or peritonitis\r\n    * Ileus\r\n    * Cholecystitis, pancreatitis, appendicitis, hepatitis\r\n    * In children, it can be caused by an allergic reaction to cow&#39;s milk proteins (milk allergy)\r\n\r\nSensory system and brain\r\n\r\nCauses in the sensory system:\r\n\r\n    * Movement: motion sickness (which is caused by overstimulation of the labyrinthine canals of the ear)\r\n    * M\u00e9ni\u00e8re&#39;s disease\r\n\r\nCauses in the brain:\r\n\r\n    * Concussion\r\n    * Cerebral hemorrhage\r\n    * Migraine\r\n    * Brain tumors, which can cause the chemoreceptors to malfunction\r\n    * Benign intracranial hypertension and hydrocephalus\r\n\r\nMetabolic disturbances (these may irritate both the stomach and the parts of the brain that coordinate vomiting):\r\n\r\n    * Hypercalcemia (high calcium levels)\r\n    * Uremia (urea accumulation, usually due to renal failure)\r\n    * Adrenal insufficiency\r\n    * Hypoglycemia\r\n\r\nPregnancy:\r\n\r\n    * Hyperemesis, Morning sickness\r\n\r\nDrug reaction (vomiting may occur as an acute somatic response to):\r\n\r\n    * alcohol (being sick whilst being drunk or being sick the next morning suffering from the after-effects, i.e. the hangover).\r\n    * opioids\r\n    * selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors\r\n    * many chemotherapy drugs\r\n    * some entheogens (such as peyote or ayahuasca)\r\n\r\nOther\r\n\r\n    * Self-induced\r\n          o Eating disorders (anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa)\r\n          o Sexual fetish (emetophilia)\r\n          o To remove a poison in case such has been ingested (some poisons should not be vomited as they may be more toxic when inhaled or aspirated; it is generally considered better to ask for help before inducing vomiting)\r\n          o Some people who are engaged in binge drinking will induce vomiting in order to make room in their stomachs for further alcohol consumption.
