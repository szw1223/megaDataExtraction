      "answer_content": "Try running too. Fast food is terrible for you. stay away from soda. drink water. also increase your reps/weight. keep a book that says how much you do, what you ate, when you ate, and drink plenty of water. Four meals a day instead of 3 will help trim fat and keep metabolism high just make sure they are just a bit smaller than your regular 3. Make sure to eat breakfast. a healthy enough diet alone is plenty for some people. try finding a workout plan online or download an app on your phone. good luck",
