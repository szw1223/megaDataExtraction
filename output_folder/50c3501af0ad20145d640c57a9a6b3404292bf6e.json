Get a therapist for her but not the type that makes her go crazier! Talk to her, say it&#39;s not her fault, make her happy, do anything that can make her smile. Make sure that you know what&#39;s she doing at home, she might be slitting her wrists for all you know! Tell the nicest adult you ever know that can actually have the ability to help her...just make her smile a genuine smile to make her forget the pain.
