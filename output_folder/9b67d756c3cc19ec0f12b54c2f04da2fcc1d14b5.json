Problem is I don&#39;t know anything about cars. I was wondering where a good place to start learning is? I like doing things by myself, and I know I can learn fast. My father looked at it, and it&#39;s in really good condition, I just want to be able to work on it when he can&#39;t. And to fix it all on my own.", "question_timestamp": "20150511100549", "followers": 0, "number_of_answers": 2, "categories": ["Health", "Mental Health"], "answers": [{"answer_content": "WOW, I&#39;m not sure if an MG is the car you would want when you know nothing about cars. But we all have to start somewhere so atleast you are trying. I love working on all my cars, etc. But British roadsters are notorious for being problematic. The first thing you need to do is to buy or download a thorough service manual for your exact car. This will help you TONS. To me a Haynes or Chilton just doesn&#39;t do it either. Look online, I&#39;m sure you can find one. Then join a forum or 2 online that is oriented with your car. These are VERY useful in figuring things out. I&#39;m in a forum with nearly every motorcycle/car I own. I&#39;ve had help on nearly every one of them to do with something.\n\nIf it runs and drives fine right now then I wouldn&#39;t be tearing anything apart unless you just want to. I&#39;d just go over the normal inspection points.\n\nChange every fluid on the car.\nCheck for any leaks of the fluids and either fix them, or atleast know they exist so you can routinely top off that fluid.\nOn that age of a car you will want to replace most of the rubber stuff if it hasn&#39;t been done recently. Such as radiator hoses, vacuum lines, heater hoses, belts, etc.\nMake sure all your brakes are in good working order, flush and change the fluid, replace brake pads/shoes if needed. Wouldn&#39;t hurt to change the old rubber brake lines to some stainless steel braided one&#39;s. Probably $70ish for them.\nCheck and/or change spark plugs and wires. Change fuel filter.\nCheck suspension parts and see what you want to change now or later. Shocks, tie rod ends, sway bar links, lower and upper control arm bushings, ball joints, etc.\nWork on electronics to make sure all the lights etc work properly. Lube up cables such as hood latch cable, speedometer cable, tachometer cable.\n\nThe manual will direct you in detail about how to do all of the above listed things.\n\nPretty cool car though, I like them. I&#39;m looking to pick up a 70s Fiat Spyder some time this year once I find one I like enough.", "author_link": "not found", "author_name": "Anonymous", "best": "true", "dislikes": "0", "likes": 2, "timestamp": "2015-05-11T10:23:21Z"}, {"answer_content": "====&gt;&gt;tips ---&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; http://x.co/1greenLINK", "author_link": "not found", "author_name": "Anonymous", "best": "false", "dislikes": "0", "likes": 0, "timestamp": "2015-05-11T10:15:02Z"}], "authorInfor": "none", "last_updata_data": "now"}
