They stated it HELPED, however once more, no longer required. I didn&#39;t do any again handsprings or some thing, and I made the Varsity squad on my first check out. And the institution I went to was once lovely aggressive. So like different customers have stated, it rather is dependent. I might determine with both a) cheerleaders you already know that experience already been within the software, b) the athletic director at your institution can have extra knowledge, or c) there must be a few variety of a handout for cheerleading tryouts, announcing what you must be capable to do, and many others...

Always be excited bec of course who would want glum cheerleaders? Enthusiasm for what you do should be reflected in the amount of spirit and energy you contribute. ALWAYS remember that.\r\n\r\nLoosing 5 lbs? Drink lots of water, maintain a healthy diet [meaning don&#39;t eat too much, yet restrain yourself from starvation], and exercise -- A LOT. Focus on flexibility and strength. Try doing some yoga and calisthenics. Tone your muscles!!!!\r\n\r\nAlso, if you have a trampoline, you can practice your flying skills there.

Keep your head up to go up and show that you&#39;re really listening and trying to improve your technique.  As a coach, I know that it is easier to teach someone with no experience as long as they are willing to learn, than someone who has a ton of talent/experience and is unwilling to listen and learn. \r\nWhen you go up in stunts, tighten every single muscle in your body.  It not only helps you but it helps your bases to lift you.  It&#39;s easier to lift someone who is tightened up than someone who is a wet noodle.  As for exercises, choose something fun like dancing.  Put on some music and dance around the house, hey you may even make up some new moves or a new routine.
