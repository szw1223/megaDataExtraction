I eventually got to the point to where I couldn&#39;t bend my knee- it was stuck in one position.  I had to ice it and take anti-inflammatory medicine.  It turns out I have Patello-Femoral Syndrome- basically my kneecap isn&#39;t lined up properly with my femur.  my doctor gave me some stretches to improve flexiblity, and also advised I ease up on my knee.  He also suggested doing weight training on my quads, thighs to help align everything properly.\r\n\r\nI definitely suggest going to a sports doctor, but if you don&#39;t have the funds to do so, jus ease up a bit on your workouts.  If you start to feel pain, slow down or walk, and make sure to take some anti-inflammatory medicine, and ice your knee daily.  \r\n\r\nOne stretch that helped me- \r\n\r\nLie on the ground on your back.  Lift your right knee to your chest and hold in there for a few seconds- repeat with your left knee.  This stretch will help your quads.  \r\n\r\nGood Luck!", "author_link": "https://answers.yahoo.com/activity/questions?show=AA11297422", "author_name": "no", "best": "false", "dislikes": "0", "likes": 0, "timestamp": "2009-02-09T15:19:47Z"}, {"answer_content": "Obviously there is a problem.
