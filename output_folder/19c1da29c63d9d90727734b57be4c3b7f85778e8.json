Last month I got my period 4 days early. Which I know isn&#39;t a big deal, but it was strange because I am like clockwork, every 28 days. The first day was really heavy, then light for 2 more days, and I was done. Ever since then, I have been nauseated almost every morning, I have vomited one morning, and dry heaved on 3 other occasions. I am nauseated all day long. I almost feel pregnant, but I am pretty sure I&#39;m not. My husband had a vasectomy in 2005, and he is the only man I am with. So, the chances of that are rather slim. My breasts are sore and my back gets really achy. The nausea is what is most bothersome. Could the nausea be from an ulcer and the other symptoms because I am supposed to start again soon?", "question_timestamp": "20081110064739", "followers": 0, "number_of_answers": 3, "categories": ["Health", "Women's Health"], "answers": [{"answer_content": "Or perhaps this is God&#39;s way of saying you&#39;re blessed with another child?
