What is the process of getting braces? do they hurt? I have spacers right now and the hurt like crazy", "question_timestamp": "20131105152814", "followers": 0, "number_of_answers": 3, "categories": ["Health", "Dental"], "answers": [{"answer_content": "I just got my braces on yesterday and I also had a lot of over crowding which lead to my teeth being crooked and I also had an over bite. When I went they simply polished my teeth, put on the glue and stuck the brackets on. Then they hardened the glue with a special light and after the inserted the wire. After you get the bands to keep the wire in the bracket which is the bit you choose your colour, I choose purple. And then your done. It doesn&#39;t hurt putting them on but the clamp can be uncomfortable to keep your mouth open. Also the pipe which sucks up all the saliva in your mouth but that goes away instantly. Your teeth don&#39;t hurt but they feel like there is lots of stuff in your mouth and your teeth feel lose and even wobbly, it&#39;s normal. Then today when I woke up my teeth were sore and felt really sensitive but they weren&#39;t as bad as everyone says they are. I&#39;ve simply been taking ibuprofen and  paracetamol and the pain went. The only problem is the brace runs against your gums and is also very sore just make sure you have lots of wax and although you get some from the dentist get some backup because you go through it really easily. Plus don&#39;t try and bite something especially on the second day, just eat soup, noodles, scrambled egg, omelet, yogurts,ice cream and if your going to eat something harder  like chips split it in half and put it in the back of your mouth and squash it between your tongue and the roof of your mouth. Also I would recommend no fizzy drinks at first and if you have a really bad sweet tooth eat maltesers and suck on it..Good Luck!", "author_link": "not found", "author_name": "Anonymous", "best": "true", "dislikes": "0", "likes": 0, "timestamp": "2013-11-05T15:49:25Z"}, {"answer_content": "usually they will take x-rays of your teeth so they can see what they&#39;re starting with. that will be one visit. then, the next visit they can put them on- that&#39;s how it worked for my daughter, she just got hers 2 weeks ago. she&#39;s had them before but they failed to give her a retainer so she needs them again- make sure you get a retainer after they&#39;re taken off and USE it. anyway- they hurt in a different way than spacers- i hate to say it, but, it&#39;s generally your entire mouth hurts. you WILL get used to it- at first, they rub your gums, so they give you wax to put on them, but, you do get used to them. hopefully you won&#39;t have them for longer than 18 months or so- they&#39;ve gotten a lot better about not keeping people in them for 3 or 4 years like they used to- hope this helps- good luck on a nice smile :)", "author_link": "not found", "author_name": "daffodil16", "best": "false", "dislikes": "0", "likes": 0, "timestamp": "2013-11-05T23:33:43Z"}, {"answer_content": "Go look up an orthodontist.
