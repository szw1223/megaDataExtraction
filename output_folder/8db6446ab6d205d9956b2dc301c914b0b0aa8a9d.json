I was scrolling through answers last night for better ways to masturbate and I didn&#39;t really understand all of them. A lot of them said to rub your clit,  but I have no idea where that is. And do you have to actually stick something like a finger, marker, or some kind of toy in your vagina to masturbate? How do you orgasm?", "question_timestamp": "20110629091101", "followers": 0, "number_of_answers": 2, "categories": ["Health", "Women's Health"], "answers": [{"answer_content": "1) Go to your local dollar tree and buy a toothbrush with the fattest and thickest end you can find. also buy baby oil.

It can cause orgasm as well. Dont feel pressured to perform penetration, and only do so if you are comfortable with it.If you choose to do so take time to safely do so, be sure that anything you put inside you wont cut you, and is clean. Your finger is probably the safest, cut your nails and wash your hands.\r\n\r\nThe website Ive given is very detailed and accurate. There is alot of information which you should find helpful and can explore at your own pace. Ive given you the page on finding the gland for quick access to the related material.
