You ears are connected to your throat through a little tube called the Eustachian tube so it could easily spread to an ear infection that way. \r\nIf you were given penicillin it&#39;s likely because of an infection. \r\nBut yeah, the Eustachian tube connects your throat to your ear so any problems there can lead to hearing problems.", "author_link": "https://answers.yahoo.com/activity/questions?show=oVxr5B3Eaa", "author_name": "Ray &lt;3", "best": "true", "dislikes": "0", "likes": 2, "timestamp": "2009-03-04T06:47:05Z"}, {"answer_content": "It is possible to have a bad tooth infection and get conductive hearing loss.  It sounds like you are already getting the proper treatment, so I&#39;m sure that you&#39;re hearing will come back once the infection is gone.  Make sure you are not overdosing on motrin or aspirin either.  Besides the increased risk of bleeding internally, aspirin toxicity (overdose) can cause hearing problems as well.", "author_link": "https://answers.yahoo.com/activity/questions?show=V87HfMhuaa", "author_name": "ashleytheresa13", "best": "false", "dislikes": "0", "likes": 1, "timestamp": "2009-03-04T06:43:33Z"}, {"answer_content": "About two months ago I woke up and my hearing was about 85% gone. What i could hear, sounded absolutely awkward...my ears felt like they were full of cotton and everything i could hear was muffled. My doctor put me on a z-pack and it did absolutely nothing for me. He put me on something else (levaquin, i believe), and it did absolutely nothing for me. One of my friends told me to go visit my dentist and he took x-rays and discovered that I had an infected tooth. He put me on penicillin and tylenol with codeine for the pain, and told me to stop taking aspirin and other pain medications and just take the tylenol with codeine. After about a week i started to regain some of my hearing. It&#39;s been several weeks since I&#39;ve been on the penicillin and tylenol with codeine, but ive also stopped taking other pain medications to avoid having an overdose on them. Right now my hearing is at about 70 to 75% of what it was prior to the day I woke up with my hearing problems. My high range hearing is gone and i can no longer hear things like drum cymbals, tambourines and wind chimes when listening to music, nor keys or loose change jingling. At this point I have no idea if this is permanent, but I certainly hope not... however I have no doubt that my tooth infection caused this, and I will be having either a root canal done or having the tooth yanked, next week.... i don&#39;t know how long it will take for my hearing to be back at 100% or if if it will even return to the way it used to. Basically, my advice to you is, stop the aspirin, stop the ibuprofen, ask your doctor to prescribe you tylenol with codeine, take that and only that with your penicillin, and get to a dentist as soon as possible. It may take several months for your hearing to return back to normal, but freaking out does not help (trust me, i had about two straight weeks of that and the stress is not worth the agony, what&#39;s done is done and worrying about it will not make it any better). I hope you do improve quickly (the penicillin should be taking effect soon), and i would like to hear of your follow up actions with the dentist and the results of your hearing improvement.", "author_link": "https://answers.yahoo.com/activity/questions?show=bDuIczfHaa", "author_name": "Tom D", "best": "false", "dislikes": "0", "likes": 0, "timestamp": "2009-03-06T01:21:09Z"}, {"answer_content": "bad toothache hearing loss", "author_link": "https://answers.yahoo.com/activity/questions?show=csZQ54Liaa", "author_name": "?", "best": "false", "dislikes": "0", "likes": 0, "timestamp": "2016-02-08T17:00:32Z"}, {"answer_content": "Take the medicine!
