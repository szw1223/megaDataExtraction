About things that don&#39;t even matter. I&#39;ll be talking to my boyfriend about bands I&#39;ve played with, and I&#39;ll bring up 3 or 4 that I know, but definitely have never played in. It doesn&#39;t even make a difference. I&#39;ll lie about people I know, where I&#39;ve worked, hell, I&#39;ll even lie about what I had for dinner or what I&#39;m doing.\r\n\r\nI could literally be talking to someone and be on facebook and tell the person I&#39;m on myspace.\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve moved on to first year of high school, and it&#39;s already started. It&#39;s cost me a position in a band, and it&#39;s cost me a friend. I feel terribly guilty about this, but I&#39;m having difficulties stopping. I&#39;ll make the conscience decision to not lie anymore, and it&#39;ll work for, oh, say... A day, two at most. Then I go right back into it.\r\n\r\nThe thing about me, is I get excited sometimes, and I&#39;ll say or do things without thinking. Things including lying. If I&#39;m calm, I can make a concentrated effort to not lie, but if I get excited, oh man, I toss those fibs around like candy on halloween.\r\n\r\nSeeing a professional is out of the question. Aside from my lying, I have no real issues. If I told my parents, they&#39;d ask &quot;why the need to spend the money when you have no real problems?&quot; I don&#39;t want to lose the trust they have in me, because, honestly, I&#39;m a good kid. I&#39;ve always got the backs of my friends, and I&#39;ll do anything for the people I care about. This is something that I have to deal with on my own.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions? Even stories of your own if you, too, are a compulsive liar. This is ruining my life.

Most compulsive liars tell &quot;stories&quot; to male life seem more exciting, which explains why you tend to do it more when your exciting. Here&#39;s some suggestions............ Try writing stories in a journal. When you feel a fib slipping out of your mouth when talking to someone, stop and take a deep breath. Then laugh it off and be like &quot;I was just kidding by the way, i just wanted to see your face&quot; or things on those lines. Don&#39;t feel like your alone on this. Try talking to a school Councillor, it&#39;s free and they can help you decide what is best Or a trusted friend,family member ect.

Strange .. maybe you have just got into this habit. It doesn&#39;t make any sense to me. Life is easier if you tell the truth, even when you want to conceal something. Are you suffering from some sort of inferiority complex. You have been criticized so much in the past maybe that now you want to feel better and imagine that if you exaggerate and lie that life will be better and people will look at you with more respect? That&#39;s one possibility. But, if you lie about everything how can anyone believe this question? You will be treated with disrespect if you continue and your problem will be made worse.\r\nMaybe you never lie and you tell the truth all the time and ...now you are just lying this once about telling the truth all the time???????? See its confusing. I would discuss it with a doctor. Your parents will always believe you anyway!!!!
