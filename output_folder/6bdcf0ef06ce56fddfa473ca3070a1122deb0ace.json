After reading the site and watching the video I decided to give it a try.  Nine months later I was 78 pounds lighter and had a visible 4 pack of abs (still working on that 6 pack). You just got to remember no matter what you\u2019re doing to lose weight you can never give up and have to always push yourself further than the day before because at the end of the day the amount of weight you lose is entirely up to you.

I&#39;m a personal trainer and a nutritionist, so here is my advice. Start my finding out what you are eating everyday. Does it contain a lot of sugars, fats, and unhealthy carbohydrates? Try to convert those to healthier foods. Switch soda to water, chocolate bars to low-fat granola bars during snacktime, and fill you ate with more greens! \r\n\r\nSecondly, start an exercise plan. You&#39;ll have to start slow at first. Organize a time during the day when you can run, start with 30 minutes jog/walk, then slowly get rid of the walking, and eventually run for longer periods of time. \r\n\r\nExercises for the entire body is important, especially cardio, but midsection workout is important too, look up examples of midsection workouts, but of course, the crunch is a good option.\r\n\r\nSports can also help, swimming is a great way to get in shape, and staying active will help you in the long run\r\n\r\nBest of luck! Hope everything works out!", "author_link": "not found", "author_name": "Chris Y", "best": "false", "dislikes": "0", "likes": 1, "timestamp": "2011-12-22T20:59:57Z"}, {"answer_content": "Well there&#39;s no way to target your weight loss in a specific point of your body, so just aiming to lose weight in general would be your best option. I suggest lots of cardio (walking, running, stuff that gets your blood pumping) and a change in diet. Eat more fruits, vegetables, proteins, and complex carbohydrates, less saturated fats, sugars, and simple carbohydrates, but also all around eating less food. Now don&#39;t starve yourself! But try to stay in the 1200-1400 calorie range. The trick to weight loss is burning off more calories than you consume (one pound of fat is 3500 calories) so it will take a while to lose a lot of weight. \r\n\r\nALSO. One thing you absolutely do not want to do, if you&#39;re looking to lose weight, is crunches. Crunches help you build abs, yes, but if you don&#39;t lose the weight first your abs will just be hiding under a big pile of belly.", "author_link": "not found", "author_name": "Alida", "best": "false", "dislikes": "0", "likes": 0, "timestamp": "2011-12-22T21:10:01Z"}, {"answer_content": "Start running or walking, or doing some sort of cardio. 30 minutes 3-5 times a week can help take weight off quickly.
