After returning home from my freshmen year of college, I&#39;ve realized that no one seems to truly care about me. My parents still scream at me, verbally degrade me, and use violence on me. The girls who I thought were my friends, whom I went out of my way to help throughout the year, just used me to get better housing (and of course my roommate&#39;s now not coming back so I&#39;m left struggling to find someone to live with). I worked extremely hard throughout high school and am in a BS/MD program (guaranteed spot at a very highly ranked medical school), yet I can&#39;t help feel like there&#39;s something awful about me.

Forget about those girls who used you. Do you have any friends from highschool you can hangout with or a job? Keeping busy will help you not feel as depressed. As for your parents, I&#39;m not really sure if you can change that by yourself if they are using violence. Have you talked to them about how you feel?
