  "question": "Is it bad to ignore what makes you upset?",
  "question_content": "I literally never think about my past. In life, i do something and move on, whether im happy about it or not. There are alot of things I could be sad about but I&#39;m not. Whenever one of my memories comes into my head I get a quick gut wrenching feeling and then I force myself to think of something else. Like ill take a few xanax or ill call someone to come pick me up. It works but at the same time I feel a little numb emotionally. What is the best way to deal with what makes you upset?",

That remembrances, which can strengthen your spirit can be retained in memory. Mental health is an important and intricate subject.

      "answer_content": "What you are doing is short term.  You have to take some time and really think about things.  Journal instead when you think of something upsetting. Don&#39;t keep it in.   Listen to music and relate your experiences to the songs. Google what is upsetting you and read about people who went through the same thing.  It helps.  If you don&#39;t face it, it will come back an haunt you in ways you never thought.  Like the type of parent you become.  How you are in relationships, whether you get an addiction problem.  The earlier you deal with it, the better.",
