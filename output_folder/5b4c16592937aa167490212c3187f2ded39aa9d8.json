Diets are NOT healthy because they cause your body to miss out on nutrients that are vital to keep your bones, muscles, and heart healthy. A much healthier alternative is exercising. Try jogging in the morning or working out with dumbbells for thirty minutes a day. Your headaches could be a side effect from a number of things.
