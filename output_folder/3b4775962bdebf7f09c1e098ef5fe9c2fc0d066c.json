Pics!?", "question_content": "I used to be about 50 lbs over weight, then I lost it over a 5 month period. My belly was and still is fat, and I need help with it. When i lay down the skin crumples up, and i can poke into it and it stays indented...which i think is weird. The last two pics are how my belly looks now, and the one where i&#39;m holding my belly up is where i&#39;d like to be in the shortest amount of time possible, what do i need to do to get there and how long will it take? Thank you...and dont be mean, I already know my stomach is repulsive :) \r\nhttp://s802.photobucket.com/albums/yy310/wowowow776/?newest=1", "question_timestamp": "20091117173340", "followers": 0, "number_of_answers": 1, "categories": ["Health", "Diet & Fitness"], "answers": [{"answer_content": "i have a friend who had this issue. I think maybe because during the time you lost that weight there wasnt any muscle building or fat burning to lose that extra skin. I believe a way you can get rid of that is to tone your body. Start going to the gym and work on your stomach and abs. Also do cardio training as well (treadmill, eliptical, etc..)", "author_link": "not found", "author_name": "Anonymous", "best": "false", "dislikes": "0", "likes": 0, "timestamp": "2009-11-17T17:51:32Z"}], "authorInfor": "none", "last_updata_data": "now"}
