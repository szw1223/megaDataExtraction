I have the same problem, and it&#39;s one idea (not confirmed, but a theory) that I came up with. I have gone a month with my right ear completely plugged up before. It sucks, and it&#39;s really annoying, but it&#39;s probably not a big deal past that. If it persists, you&#39;ll find tricks to help, but sometimes it&#39;s unavoidable. This problem started with me sometime around October or so, and it&#39;s been on and off since then. As I said, the longest I&#39;ve gone is a month with it plugged up, but it&#39;s also had varying shorter times (2 weeks, 4 days, 1 day etc.)\r\n\r\nAnother theory that I have is actually related to your sinuses. I recently had a cold, and it happened to be during a time that my ear was plugged. I took a decongestant (one that made me sleepy, but I don&#39;t think it really matters), fell asleep, and when I woke up, my nose and ear were both clear. Outward pressure inside of your nose can possibly effect the inside of your ear canal, which may lead to temporary hearing loss. Again, just a theory.\r\n\r\nAll in all, it&#39;s really nothing to get worked up about. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s anything worse than an annoyance, however annoying it may be. If it gets too annoying for you to handle, seeing a doctor couldn&#39;t hurt.", "author_link": "https://answers.yahoo.com/activity/questions?show=Hs4Q26GGaa", "author_name": "APMathNerd", "best": "false", "dislikes": "1", "likes": 0, "timestamp": "2012-07-04T11:23:10Z"}, {"answer_content": "Hold your nose and mouth n blow out. it&#39;ll be closed for sometime but will open soon.", "author_link": "https://answers.yahoo.com/activity/questions?show=ctClceZzaa", "author_name": "suparna s", "best": "false", "dislikes": "1", "likes": 0, "timestamp": "2012-07-04T11:02:06Z"}], "authorInfor": "none", "last_updata_data": "now"}
