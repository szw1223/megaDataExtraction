You can try fish, but if your a super vegetarian then I would suggest something along the lines of tofu or lots of beans, this with a good dose of assorted vegetables, steamed carrots, broccoli, cauliflower, salads etc. And you should be good. \r\n\r\nTo loose that extra bit of weight I would suggest a supplement, you have probably heard of bodily detox? Essentialy it takes out all the chemicals out of your bodily (which are processed through colon &amp; liver) and sets it back into it&#39;s natural state. This way you will loose weight because your body will be functioning at it&#39;s highest state all the time. I used this free trial, I mean hey, you have nothing to loose by just trying it right? But it&#39;s your choice! \r\n\r\nhttp://moveto.ws/z1r91wkxk", "author_link": "not found", "author_name": "Anonymous", "best": "false", "dislikes": "0", "likes": 0, "timestamp": "2009-08-12T12:07:13Z"}], "authorInfor": "none", "last_updata_data": "now"}
