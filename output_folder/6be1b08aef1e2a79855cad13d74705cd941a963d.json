However, the biggest change of self perception comes from within. You have to love yourself as a person, not as an object. Try picking something new every day that you like about yourself as is. Focus on that for the day. You are not your weight.\r\n\r\nAs for the losing weight part, no diet pill is going to get you permanent sustainable loss. Often they end up making you jittery and sick feeling. When you quit taking them, IF you lost anything to begin with, you will most likely gain it back. You need an eating plan that is doable and realistic. No fad or fancy things. Just good whole and healthy food. Think complex carbs, whole grains, lean meats, lots of fruit and vegetables. \r\n\r\nThe opinion varies on water and it&#39;s role in true weight loss, but my opinion is that it&#39;s necessary anyway. So drink lots. I&#39;ve read that you should consume half your body weight in pounds into ounces. For example, if you weigh 100 pounds, then you should drink 50 ounces of water. Often that is unrealistic and kind of hard to do. Plus you get a lot of your water from your foods. So it&#39;s nice to aim for the 8 cups a day. It&#39;s not really that much when you sip all day long. It&#39;s a smart thing to do and just good for your body in general.\r\n\r\nYou should also exercise. It&#39;s not always necessary for it to be painful. You should know your body well enough to understand the threshold between muscle fatigue and exertion pain and dangerous injury pain. You should focus on quality and quantity over intensity. Like walking or running, whatever you ability level. You should keep it up for as long as is comfortable. The intensity level should be to the point that it&#39;s difficult but not impossible to talk to someone in small amounts.  The general idea is that you should move your body. They suggest alternating cardio, which burns fat.. with strength which builds and tones muscles on different days.\r\n\r\nCheck out some websites. Look for a calorie calculator that will tell you how many calories you should consume in order to lose a rational amount of pounds a week (usually about 2). \r\n\r\nAlso.. don&#39;t get discouraged if you fall off the wagon. Things happen and we all learn and grow by making mistakes. Just don&#39;t beat yourself up over it. Identify why you messed up and take the proper steps to prevent it from happening gain. And above all else.. keep trying!", "author_link": "not found", "author_name": "eirlys", "best": "false", "dislikes": "0", "likes": 0, "timestamp": "2007-11-12T20:42:24Z"}, {"answer_content": "First of all, take foods which contain low calories like protein containing food such as white meat fish and chicken. When you are eating meal avoid sitting in front of computer or television because it may enhance the deposition of fat.
