It was slightly swollen and kinda red and very painful. I cleaned it up with some peroxide and triple antibiotic cream then bandaged it up and thought it was going to be okay. It had some sort of meat bubble and it looked like it had blood inside of it (that really made me nervous). The wound was looking somewhat better and i thought it was starting to go away but then it started hurting REALLY bad and now can&#39;t wear regular tennis shoes because the pressure hurts too bad. I really wish i knew what the heck is on my foot! \r\n\r\nIf anyone knows what this is, can you please help?", "question_timestamp": "20110219145637", "followers": 0, "number_of_answers": 1, "categories": ["Health", "Diseases & Conditions", "Other - Diseases"], "answers": [{"answer_content": "it may be infected; the pain is an indication of something wrong plus the redness and swelling are indicative of possible infection too. go asap to the doctor- do not wait another day.", "author_link": "https://answers.yahoo.com/activity/questions?show=WEUw86CTaa", "author_name": "sharon g", "best": "false", "dislikes": "0", "likes": 0, "timestamp": "2011-02-19T15:04:45Z"}], "authorInfor": "none", "last_updata_data": "now"}
