However you need to gentily pull back your foreskin every day. And when you have a shower, gentily pull it back and clean the head of your penis.  Be gentle though.  Eventually your foreskin will roll back over the head very easily.  Then you will find masturbating much more pleasurable.  \r\n(Personal experiance).\r\n\r\nThere are many website that you can find that will give you info on the &#39;foreskin&quot;.\r\n\r\nAs an adolescent, the uncircumcised male should retract, or pull back, the foreskin and clean underneath it daily. It should be a part of his daily hygiene routine. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) states that the foreskin should be cleansed by following the steps below:  \r\n  \r\nGently, not forcefully, pull the foreskin away from the tip of the penis. \r\nRinse the tip of the penis and the inside part of the foreskin with soap and water. \r\nReturn the foreskin back over the tip of the penis. \r\n \r\nhttp://www.childrenshospital.org/az/Site652/mainpageS652P0.html", "author_link": "not found", "author_name": "Anonymous", "best": "false", "dislikes": "0", "likes": 1, "timestamp": "2008-03-29T12:00:54Z"}, {"answer_content": "No, absolutely NOT.
