As long as the discharge is clear, it&#39;s okay. Make sure it&#39;s not lumpy-textured though. I&#39;m guessing it&#39;s just all a part of puberty and her body may be preparing itself for a period. This started happening to me about a year before my first period.\n\nThere are sprays and wipes you can buy at grocery stores and supermarkets. But ask her if she&#39;s using soap or not down there, sometimes soap can mess up the PH balance and cause infection, especially when the body is going through puberty. The vagina is self-cleaning, so really all you need is warm water and very gentle, mild-scented soap at the most down there.", "author_link": "not found", "author_name": "Brooke Bailey", "best": "false", "dislikes": "0", "likes": 0, "timestamp": "2014-01-03T17:09:18Z"}, {"answer_content": "The clear gooey stuff is discharge.
