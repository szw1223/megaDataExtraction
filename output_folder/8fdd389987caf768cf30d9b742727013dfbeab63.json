My last period was lighter and shorter than normal but normally they are very heavy indeed so it still was not very light. It is not totally impossible that I am pregnant but it is very unlikely as I have only had sex once in the past month and we used protection. Also I have no other signs of pregnancy. \r\n\r\nFor the past month I have been taking regularly MSM with Vitamin C and Iron tablets the latter for anemia due to heavy periods ironically. Prior to this recent upset my periods always came about once ever 21 to 26 days, were very heavy and lasted about a week from start to finish,\r\n\r\nI am worried about the menopause but I still think I am a bit young for that. Is there any other reason I could be late? Is some alteration of cycle normal now and again?", "question_timestamp": "20111214061857", "followers": 0, "number_of_answers": 2, "categories": ["Health", "Women's Health"], "answers": [{"answer_content": "Your first step would be to take a pregnancy test.  If you are pregnant, there could very well be no other signs of pregnancy at this early stage.  You are a little young for menopause, although it is not unheard of at your age.  Periods can be late for a variety of reasons, from hormonal imbalances, to too much exercise, to too much stress.  If you are not having any pain and a pregnancy test is negative, this is probably just a temporary hormonal imbalance of some sort.  If you skip your period next month as well, it would be a good idea to see your physician.", "author_link": "none", "author_name": "Anonymous", "best": "true", "dislikes": "0", "likes": 0, "timestamp": "2011-12-14T06:30:25Z"}, {"answer_content": "It&#39;s normal to have fluctuations in a woman&#39;s cycle, even if it has been regular for a long time.
