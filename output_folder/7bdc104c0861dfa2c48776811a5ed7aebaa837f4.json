It&#39;s like I&#39;m dreaming but it hurts and it&#39;s an annoying sorta feeling. Every now and then my jaw aches but today it was sooo painful I could of cried.. I was at school, so I told my teacher and she said she had the same problem as me she was grinding her teeth while sleeping so she said I should get a mouth guard while sleeping. It&#39;s really weird, I can&#39;t describe how it feels when I&#39;m sleeping, I know I do it I just can&#39;t figure how what exactly it is and why! I&#39;m 14 year old girl anyway :)", "question_timestamp": "20130426040215", "followers": 0, "number_of_answers": 2, "categories": ["Health", "General Health Care", "Injuries"], "answers": [{"answer_content": "Well I&#39;m 13 and I had TMJ when I was 12. It&#39;s the feeling that you can&#39;t open your jaw wide enough because it is sort of stuck. It is sometimes annoying, sometimes painful. I went to the doctor and they gave me a mouth guard to wear for a month and a retainer to wear for like.. 2 months I think? I still have it now but it is way way better. \r\n\r\nSo my advice is... go visit the doctor I guess.
