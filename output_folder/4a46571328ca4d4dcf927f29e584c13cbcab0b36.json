Cardio comes in 3rd in importance.\n\n3500 cals = approx 1lbs of fat.\n\nIf you are already in your healthy weight range you will only want to aim to lose 1/2 lbs/week. Anything more may cause your metabolism to slow and weightloss to come to a stand still as your body enters starvation mode.\n\nAny strength training exercise you do, you should only be able to do 8-15 reps in a set before your muscle reach exhaustation (you can&#39;t do another rep in good form).
