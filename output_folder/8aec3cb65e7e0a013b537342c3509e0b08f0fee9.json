I like Balance Bars (15g protein) because they are guaranteed low glycemic index foods and they come in a wide variety of flavors.  I have one every afternoon with 8 oz of milk to get over 20g of protein.  I also have a whey protein drink every morning (between breakfast and lunch).  I prefer EAS chocolate flavor mixed with milk and plain yogurt.  If you use whey protein in moderation you do not need to worry about the cholesterol content.  One serving of whey protein =  22% of the DRV for cholesterol.  I&#39;ve been drinking it for two years, and my cholesterol is very low.\r\n\r\n2. Your best bet is to get protein from natural sources.  I eat A LOT of rotisserie chicken.  Some eggs, cottage cheese, lean beef and pork.  Also, I really like the Kashi Go Lean Hi Protein hot and cold cereals.  They are whole grain and high protein.  I also keep a few &quot;Lean Cuisine&quot; and &quot;South Beach Diet&quot; frozen meals in the freezer.  Some people will use Tofu or other soy protein, but I&#39;m not really into that.  \r\n\r\n3. If you are just starting to investigate your nutrition relative to muscle development, then stick with the natural proteins but supplement 1-2x per day with protein bars and drinks.  Your best bet is to eat 5-6 small meals (each containing at least 20g protein) per day.  \r\n\r\nI&#39;ve been on the Body for Life nutrition plan for almost two years, and I can vouch that the &quot;controlled carb, increased protein&quot; diet -- used in conjunction with a disciplined weight lifting plan -- will achieve results.  You will build lean muscle mass.  However, you need to do the nutrition AND the exercise for it to work.", "author_link": "https://answers.yahoo.com/activity/questions?show=AA11597534", "author_name": "Strider_Vt", "best": "true", "dislikes": "0", "likes": 0, "timestamp": "2006-06-23T09:06:41Z"}, {"answer_content": "Low CARB Protein Powder from EAS.\r\nLow CARB Protein Bar from EAS.\r\nEgg Protein Powder from EAS.\r\n\r\nIf your are a biginner,I would sugget (8-7-6)reps.Eat good.9-11 hrs of rest.Have 5-6 times protein shake daily.2 of them are VERY important (One half hr before going to sleep&amp; the other would be 3 in the morning.lol\r\nGOOD luck", "author_link": "https://answers.yahoo.com/activity/questions?show=AA12392164", "author_name": "MAT", "best": "false", "dislikes": "0", "likes": 0, "timestamp": "2006-06-23T15:56:12Z"}, {"answer_content": "When you smell nitrogen you will know you have consumed too much protien and should cut back at leats 25% or you will expend energy digesting extra protien you would otherwise be using to form your body out of protien.
