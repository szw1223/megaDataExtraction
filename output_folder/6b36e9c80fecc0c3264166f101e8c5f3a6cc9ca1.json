What can quicken the healing process?&quot; Like I said before when you posted this question the first time, TIME. Take care of yourself and treat your symptoms and you could be ready. The duration of swine flu is up to 7 days with an average of 4. You were infected 2-4 days before you even had symptoms. I don&#39;t know how long you had symptoms before seeing a doctor and getting your diagnosis but you know this and you can do some simple math and make an estimate. Try to refrain from making multiple postings of the same question. That&#39;s a no-no.", "author_link": "not found", "author_name": "?", "best": "false", "dislikes": "0", "likes": 0, "timestamp": "2016-05-24T09:58:21Z"}, {"answer_content": "keep your hand away from your eyes,mouth,open cuts, and always wash your hand. the swine flu is a virus which means it can only enter threw those particular areas. I don&#39;t think you have it. You said you got back Saturday? well if you did the flu would of already started. Trust me if you had it you would know it.\r\n\r\nIt would still be good to get your self checked out and to cover you mouth, not using your hand using your arm. Always wash your hands.\r\nyour fine.\r\nEDIT: as of now scientist have no clue how fast the virus spreads. They believe it takes the same amount of hours that a normal flu does. If you have it, there is nothing to be worried about. the only reason why people were dieing in Mexico is because Mexico has BAD health care. Were in America, we have cures. 3 kids had and and now there fine.
