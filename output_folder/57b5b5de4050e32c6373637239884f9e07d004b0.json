It feels like a sore knotted muscle right next to the spine or disc.  I don\u2019t know the name or number of the bone/area, but it seems to be right at the bottom of my ribcage at the smallest part of my waist.  I think I tend to have more of an hour glass figure, but with too much weight, I can still have the stomach-hip ratio of an apple shape, which probably means the excess belly weight is hurting my back. In addition, having poor posture is probably not helping, either.  The pain is most noticeable when I am under stress. I notice when I am under a certain weight, it goes away. I know the obvious answer is to loose weight and improve posture (in progress; already lost 20lbs).  I\u2019ve had this for a few years now and massaging doesn\u2019t seem to get it out.  Could this be something serious? Should I check into a chiropractor?  My doctor prescribed me Mobic (Meloxicam), but only based on what I told him (he didn\u2019t physically check it out).  And are there any type of exercises for the lower back that can help? Stretches? Any comment, advice would help.", "question_timestamp": "20111212211242", "followers": 0, "number_of_answers": 8, "categories": ["Health", "General Health Care", "Pain & Pain Management"], "answers": [{"answer_content": "Lumbar spine.

Emotions, some people may disagree but I believe can manifest themselves into something more physical.\r\n\r\nPoor posture is 90% of NSLBP.  Non-specific lower back pain.  \r\n\r\nYou need to retrain your core muscles - I&#39;m not talking superficial here - I&#39;m talking your transversus abdominals.  You must re-learn to fire these when moving.  \r\n\r\nSo you have a weak core and I bet tight hips / hamstrings.  Stretches are excellent.

Lose weight, start some with some stretches and then I would definitely start on some resistance type training.  Proper strength training - do not do body-building training.  Body building is all about appearance and not ability.  \r\n\r\nYou need proper strength training where we target the postural deeper muscles.  \r\n\r\nHope this helps, best of luck!", "author_link": "not found", "author_name": "Anonymous", "best": "true", "dislikes": "0", "likes": 0, "timestamp": "2011-12-12T21:25:08Z"}, {"answer_content": "I completely understand your lower back pain. I suffer from chronic pain including lower back pain in my lumbar spine. This is a result of RSD and Fibromyalgia along with other medical conditions.
