I&#39;ve just turned 21 and recently noticed my belly starting to protrude while sitting. I  definitely don&#39;t need to lose weight as I&#39;m underweight. I&#39;ve been doing 30 reps/3 sets of ab workouts nightly. My dad is also skinny and his gut protrudes past his waistline. Will ab workouts fix this problem..or should I start a new diet and beef up somehow?", "question_timestamp": "20101129181856", "followers": 0, "number_of_answers": 2, "categories": ["Health", "Diet & Fitness"], "answers": [{"answer_content": "That&#39;s actually a sign of malnutrition... it&#39;s usually caused by a lack of protein in a person&#39;s diet, but can also result from a lack of other nutrients and/or vitamins.\r\n\r\nSo simple solution... eat more meat.", "author_link": "not found", "author_name": "raina_vissora", "best": "false", "dislikes": "0", "likes": 0, "timestamp": "2010-11-29T18:27:42Z"}, {"answer_content": "as long as you can suck it in i think its fine \r\ni wouldn&#39;t try and lose wait if i were you", "author_link": "not found", "author_name": "Anonymous", "best": "false", "dislikes": "0", "likes": 0, "timestamp": "2010-11-29T18:20:46Z"}], "authorInfor": "none", "last_updata_data": "now"}
