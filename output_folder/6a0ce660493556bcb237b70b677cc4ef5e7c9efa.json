They have a foul smell. I can&#39;t see them inside my mouth. But they occassionally &#39;fall out&#39; when I cough. The odour is soooo bad. At first I thought they were food particles, but no.. this has happened atleast 2-3 times in the past week. They are not big at all, they&#39;re very small.. no particular shape. What is it, and how do I get rid of them?", "question_timestamp": "20080326053431", "followers": 0, "number_of_answers": 11, "categories": ["Health", "Men's Health"], "answers": [{"answer_content": "These hard white chunks are called tonsilliths. They usually occur in tonsils with deep crevices or crypts which allow food particles and other debris to accumulate. Bacteria begin to grow in this accumulation of debris and often produces a foul smell or taste, especially when one of these are dislodged. Occasionally these areas can be the source for chronic or recurrent infections. \r\nThe best treatment of tonsilliths is to keep the tonsils clean. This can often be accomplished with gargling, a water pick, or manually cleaning the crypts with a Q-tip for example. \r\n\r\nOccasionally, the problem cannot be easily managed and the tonsils have to be removed.", "author_link": "https://answers.yahoo.com/activity/questions?show=WWRUDrdhaa", "author_name": "Heather R", "best": "true", "dislikes": "0", "likes": 2, "timestamp": "2008-03-26T05:48:51Z"}, {"answer_content": "Hello, I can&#39;t imagine what it is but I would definitely want to ask my doctor about this. You visit with the doctor would be so much more productive if you could present him with a sample. Carry a sterile bottle, or have some saran wrap handy, and capture the material so that it can be analyzed. Keep a food diary and see is there is a connection to what you eat. Note if there is any pain What does it taste like? Get a sample of the saliva during this bad taste time. How often does this happen? If you think it imight be GERD (acid reflux) you might try Prilosec. The taste from acid reflux would be acidic and burn and nasty. Take a look at your tonsils, are they swollen - do they seem to have pockets where you might see something white. it might be from the tonsil. Good Luck...........
