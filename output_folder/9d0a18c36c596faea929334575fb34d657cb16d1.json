Now lots of other &quot;diseases&quot; are springing up, like &quot;restless legs,&quot; &quot;overactive bladder,&quot; men&#39;s prostate &quot;growing problems,&quot; etc., not to mention the ongoing hype reminding us constantly that our cholesterol is high, our blood pressure is high, we can&#39;t sleep, we&#39;re too nervous, etc.\r\n\r\nI think America is a pretty healthy country, and if we would lose some weight and get some exercise we&#39;d be even healthier.

I have always thought that there are just plainly too many drugs. Don&#39;t get my wrong, I am all for things like taking pain meds for headaches, or after things like surgery; however I also believe that America has a drug dependecy on pain meds. &quot;I have arthritis, take a pill!&quot; or &quot;I have a war injury from 1965, take a pill!&quot; People went thousands of years without the loads of drugs we put into our bodies nowadays.\r\n\r\nWhat is the effect all these drugs are having on us? We are living longer to experience things that we have never expierenced before? Like....heart failure? Kidney failure? Cancer? \r\n\r\nWhy do we have all these drugs? To fix problems with the human body. Someone is born with deficiency of some sort, so they are to take a supplement for the rest of their life.

However, I think that people should be the ones who help people figure out what&#39;s wrong, not drug commercials. The big problem today is our terrible health care system; doctors only care about money, not people&#39;s health, so they just sell a bunch of drugs and don&#39;t really help people with their problems. What happens is people just put more and more chemicals in their bodies (for problems that could easily be fixed by more natural cures, I might add), which lead to more problems that they take more drugs for, and a vicious cycle starts. These days, everything health-related is ruled by money and the wishes of corrupt drug companies. (This is one of the many reasons I would never consider a career in medicine, even though I have quite a bit of health information- I&#39;ll give people my input for free, but I refuse to take money for it. Good health is something everyone should have access to, not just the rich and those with great insurance.)", "author_link": "https://answers.yahoo.com/activity/questions?show=XL3gqhVxaa", "author_name": "Lycanthrope777", "best": "false", "dislikes": "0", "likes": 0, "timestamp": "2007-08-14T03:49:51Z"}, {"answer_content": "If you think that America is a pretty healthy country, think again.
