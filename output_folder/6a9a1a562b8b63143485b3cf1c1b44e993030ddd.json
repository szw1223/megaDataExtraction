That is it, you do not have to do any ab exercises. If you want to get define 6 pack abs, than the ab workout would help; although good nutrition and cardio is the key for that too; all ab workouts do is strengthen your core and make your ab muscles more define; but everyone has a 6 pack, even if it is under fat.\r\n\r\nBut my short answer for you is cardio (running, sports, biking), not walking; RUNNING; get that heart rate going up to burn more calories. Eat right, and less; you should be seeing results in a couple of weeks if you do it right. DO NOT STARVE yourself, eat small meals throughout the day; a meal could be a banana and a glass of milk. Or a salad.\r\n\r\nBest of luck.", "author_link": "none", "author_name": "Anonymous", "best": "true", "dislikes": "0", "likes": 0, "timestamp": "2012-04-30T16:13:08Z"}, {"answer_content": "Sit-ups and crunches are the exercises to do for abs. But as another answer notes, sit-ups and crunches won&#39;t get rid of belly fat. Or it&#39;ll have minimal effect. For that, you have to lose weight. There&#39;s no way to target just one part of the body (whether it&#39;s your tummy or rear end or thighs) for weight loss.\r\n\r\nFor weight loss, you have to take in fewer calories than you burn. So the approach there is to reduce what you&#39;re eating and exercise more. Treadmill or eliptical are fine for the exercises. You certainly can throw some sit-ups or crunches in the mix; that won&#39;t hurt at all. But most of the improvement you want will come from simply losing a few pounds.\r\n\r\nBy the way, though it varies somewhat, a general guideline is to lose no more than 2 pounds a week. Any more, and you&#39;re stressing your body way too much. But if you lose 2 pounds a week, you can take off about 15 pounds by June 20. That&#39;ll require dieting and exercise, but I&#39;ll bet 15 pounds would make your tummy look a lot flatter.\r\n\r\nGood luck.", "author_link": "https://answers.yahoo.com/activity/questions?show=g0dT3uyfaa", "author_name": "?", "best": "false", "dislikes": "0", "likes": 0, "timestamp": "2012-04-30T16:19:00Z"}, {"answer_content": "Nutrition.
