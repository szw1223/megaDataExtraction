Somehow I&#39;ve gotten myself through high school and onto university without much effort (yeah I guess I&#39;m pretty smart), but now I&#39;ve gotten to the point where I am spending ALL my time on youtube, video games, T.V, wasting time with friends. I am slowly feeling the effects of not studying with my test marks as a reflection. I now also realize I can&#39;t get by anymore without doing the proper work, but I just can&#39;t seem to get myself out of this hoe I dug myself into. \r\n\r\nI am constantly playing games on steam, or PS3, on a daily basis. I also watch a lot of hockey on T.V. I love these things but I believe it&#39;s about time I start prioritizing those behind my school work. \r\n\r\nOften during school nights where I sleep 2-3 hours due to staying up playing games, resulting in energyless for school the following day.\r\nI also feel that once I fall behind in a course load, I would just &quot;give up&quot; and neglect the homework/ studying required even further.\r\n\r\nEven now, with having two finals tomorrow which I am not ready for, I am still having problems focusing on studying. \r\n\r\nHow can I fix this problem? I feel like I have little motivation to study.
