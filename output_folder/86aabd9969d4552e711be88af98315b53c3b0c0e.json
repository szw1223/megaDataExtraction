I saw his face and a little bit of his upper body, but not a full picture.  He told me he is 6&#39;2&quot; and weighs 170 lbs. and has an athletic build.  If a guy is that tall, wouldn&#39;t he weigh more if he had an athletic build?  Does 170 lbs. sound real thin?  I was just curious on what the average weight would be for a 6&#39;2&quot; guy with an athletic build.  I thought at least 200.", "question_timestamp": "20071229141837", "followers": 0, "number_of_answers": 7, "categories": ["Health", "Diet & Fitness"], "answers": [{"answer_content": "that sounds like a good height and weight, he could be athletic", "author_link": "not found", "author_name": "talldude347", "best": "true", "dislikes": "0", "likes": 1, "timestamp": "2007-12-29T14:28:00Z"}, {"answer_content": "He is probably thin.  It doesn&#39;t mean he is not athletic. I&#39;ll use myself as an example so you can compare body weight and height since I am very close to his height.  I am 215lbs and 6&#39;1&quot; tall.  I am on the leaner side at about 11 to 12 percent body fat but not vein/ab popping lean.  I would not consider myself a buff guy I&#39;m actually pretty thin/average I think.  I&#39;m right between a medium/large shirt but when I go to get fitted for a suit I&#39;m told I have an athletic body type.  I don&#39;t think how much you weigh or how big you look determines your body type.  I think it is more about how big your shoulders and thighs are compared to how small your waist is.\r\n\r\nThat being said.  I&#39;m 45 lbs heavier than that guy.  I am a size 32 waist.  The only way for me to lose 45 lbs would be to lose a lot of muscle mass.  So I&#39;m going to have to say I think this guy is really thin.  But he could have large shoulders giving him an athletic look.  \r\n\r\nTo add a little more I&#39;ve trained quite a few people and have worked out with many people and have never seen a 6&#39;2&quot; guy who weighed 170 pounds that would not be considered thin.\r\n\r\nBut his idea of athletic might be different than yours.  You might have more of a football player image in your head than say a tennis player.", "author_link": "not found", "author_name": "CW26", "best": "false", "dislikes": "0", "likes": 1, "timestamp": "2007-12-29T14:55:45Z"}, {"answer_content": "6 Foot 170 Pounds", "author_link": "not found", "author_name": "Anonymous", "best": "false", "dislikes": "0", "likes": 0, "timestamp": "2016-11-12T07:46:51Z"}, {"answer_content": "It depends on whether he works out allot.\r\nHe if definitely on the thin side.
