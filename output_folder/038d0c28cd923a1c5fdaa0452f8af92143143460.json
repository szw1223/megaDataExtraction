You can argue the fact that not only is it good exercise but just something you can learn if you ever need to protect yourself. And, if you enjoy it, maybe that can somehow lead you into boxing (if you&#39;re still interested in it) and possibly, your mom will back you up after some time.\r\n\r\nBiking and swimming are good too, because they can be done either alone or with others as well as just for fun or as exercise. You can also choose to take it easy or really push yourself with either sport. \r\nIf you have access to a racquetball court and any interest, racquetball can be fun too...especially on a bad day. It&#39;s good to whack a ball around the court as hard as possible to de-stress. And, it&#39;s a great workout as well.", "author_link": "not found", "author_name": "paperpirate13", "best": "false", "dislikes": "0", "likes": 0, "timestamp": "2008-06-04T16:37:59Z"}, {"answer_content": "There&#39;s nothing wrong with dancing.
