Help?", "question_content": "In September of this year, I delivered my daughter who was still born at 38 weeks. I went to the hospital on the 10th because she wasn&#39;t moving that much, and returned on the 13th with the same complaint and they couldnt find her heart beat. I went home that night and returned the next day to be induced and had her the 15th. After I delivered her, we learned she passed away because her cord was in a true knot and wrapped around her neck twice. \r\nEver since then, I have dreams every single night. In my dream, it is like a view of the inside of my uterus with my daughter inside and I get to watch how she died. I either have that dream or another dream where someone I know will blame me and tell me its my fault that my daughter died. \r\nI also live very close to the hospital I delivered my daughter at and every time I drive by my heart starts racing and I feel like crying and have trouble breathing. \r\nOn  September 22, my doctor put me on Lexapro because it is an anti depressant that i&#39;ve taken before. It doesnt work anymore. It makes me feel jittery, keeps me awake (I barely get sleep), my thoughts are always jumbled and I feel like I can&#39;t think straight, hurts my stomach and makes me not hungry so I barely eat. I just want something that will help me sleep at night and that will help me help myself but Lexapro is just making me feel worse and my doctor won&#39;t listen, he tells me to just keep trying it and it will probably start helping but its already December and I can&#39;t take this anymore. \r\nWhat should I do? I know that I need to go to a different doctor, but what medicines should I talk to the doctor about?\r\nHave any of ya&#39;ll been in a similar situation and got medicine that helped? If so, please answer. I need any help I can get. I&#39;m really at the end of my rope. \r\nThanks so much in advance.", "question_timestamp": "20091207205049", "followers": 0, "number_of_answers": 8, "categories": ["Health", "Mental Health"], "answers": [{"answer_content": "This is a eating disorder, seek help.", "author_link": "not found", "author_name": "Anonymous", "best": "true", "dislikes": "0", "likes": 0, "timestamp": "2009-12-07T20:58:03Z"}, {"answer_content": "First I am so sorry this happened to you. I can imagine how awful this must be for you.\r\nAnti-depressants, if they are going to work will take sometimes 6-8 weeks. It&#39;s been that long now so you need to go back to your doctor again now that the right amount of time has passed. If you can, take someone who can be advocate for you... Mom, husband, boyfriend, sister... someone who can be firm if the doctor doesn&#39;t believe you. It would be good to get some help through grief counseling too.

I&#39;ve had two friends deliver stillborn babies (I attended the one delivery) and other people expect you to &quot;shake it off&quot;.

Obviously it&#39;s been longer than that. Although you need to &quot;work with&quot; the depressant, it&#39;s a shame your doctor isn&#39;t taking your complaints to heart. I&#39;m not a doc, but I suffer from depression myself. It sounds like you suffer from anxiety and panic attacks as well. I definitely recommend you seek a second opinion; maybe he/she can treat you with Xanax for the anxiety, sedatives to help you sleep, and some counseling to come to terms with your loss.
