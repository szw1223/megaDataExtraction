I give him his meds every night ( singular, claritian, nasonex pulmicort) and then it flairs up zopanex.  My question is he just had bhronchitis in november.  Here it is mid december and I noticed a cough again.  Last January he had to be hospilized for it.  I am giving him his meds like clockwork. Never misses a dose but he keeps getting sick.  Is that normal for a kid with alleregy induced asthma ( he is allergic to dust mites and mold) .  He does not act like he feels bad but that cough concerns me.  I take him to the doctor ( might as well go on and move in) he has missed over a week of school so far.  Does it get better as he gets older?  Does he need more aggressive treatment? Or is this just part of having an asthmatic child????", "question_timestamp": "20061214062421", "followers": 0, "number_of_answers": 10, "categories": ["Health", "Diseases & Conditions", "Allergies"], "answers": [{"answer_content": "Unfortunately it can be part of having an asthmatic child. My 7 yr old daughter has asthma and is allergic to dustmites. She takes Singulair, Advair and an Albuterol inhaler when needed. She often coughs. But she is still very active (plays soccer). There is a place online called &quot;National Allergy&quot; , they sell items at reasonable costs that reduce dustmites. Get Dustmitex and add it to water to clean your carpets. There is also an item called De-mite, you put it in your laundry to remove dustmites. Sometimes a cool mist humidifier in the bedroom helps (not always, allergists have different opinions on that.) When the coughing flares up, cool caffeinated drinks help. It is frustrating and difficult sometimes, but remember , when he goes to school he will be exposed to sick kids which aggravates the asthma, it can&#39;t be helped sometimes. If you have concerns contact the doctor, but kids are very resilient! If you have any questions or want to vent, feel free to e-mail me.

The best non medication treatment for asthma is learning your triggers and avoiding them. Common triggers are smoke, dust, mold, mildew, plants, dust mites, pets and grass/weeds. \n\nIf you can not figure our your triggers, you may need to see an allergist and have allergy screening done. This may point out your triggers. \n\nThe National Asthma Prevention Program and the Expert Panel of Diagnosis and Management of Asthma both agree if you have to use a prescription inhaler such as albuterol more then two time per week, your asthma is NOT in control and you will need a prescription controller medication. \n\nController medications are steroids (Asthmacort Asthmanex, Flovent, Pulmocort), Leukotriene modifier (Singulair, Aculade, Zyflo) or mast cell stabilizers (Cromolyn sodium, Intal, Tilade). \n\nYou may want to talk to your doctor about several strong controller medications and maybe Xolair shots.\n\nIf you want a proven, all-natural way to cure your asthma, without having to pay for useless medications with harmful side-effects, then this is the most important page you&#39;ll ever read.", "author_link": "not found", "author_name": "Anonymous", "best": "false", "dislikes": "0", "likes": 0, "timestamp": "2016-05-15T06:04:07Z"}, {"answer_content": "2", "author_link": "not found", "author_name": "Maria", "best": "false", "dislikes": "0", "likes": 0, "timestamp": "2016-07-27T17:56:55Z"}, {"answer_content": "I am raising a granddaughter who is 2 1/2. She has had asthma since she came home from the hospital. We own a nebulizer and when hers starts to get bad she has 2 treatments a day of the Pulmicort and Albuterol Sulfate mixed together and then 3 additional treatments of the Albuterol Sulfate. Every year I get her the flu shot and every one in the house gets it plus we all get the pneumonia shot too.\r\n\r\nShe has not had an episode at all so far this fall. I would ask for a nebulizer and the medications my little one is on. It gets rid of the nasty cough right away.
