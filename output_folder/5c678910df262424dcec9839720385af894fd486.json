There is really nothing that can be done about this. \r\nThe other cause that most people know about is a deficiency of growth\r\nhormone, which is produced by the pituitary gland situated at the base\r\nof the brain. If a deficiency of this hormone is discovered early\r\nenough in life, it is sometimes possible to give treatment with\r\ninjections of growth hormone to increase height. However, by the time\r\nyou get to 17 years of age, your bones may not respond to the effect\r\nof the hormone. The only way to find out if you have this condition is\r\nto discuss it with your doctor. Blood tests an X-rays to see how your\r\nbones are growing can usually make the diagnosis, but for treatment\r\nyou would need referral to a specialist. These investigations should\r\nalso show if there is any other cause for your short stature. \r\nBut you should not think that it will definitely help you. Medical\r\nscience can not make you the way you want to be - and it is true not\r\nonly for height - so it&#39;s better to accept yourself as you are. Tall\r\npeople are not necessary happier than short people - look at the\r\ntallest man in Ukraine, who was stripped of his title, lives alone\r\nwith his mother, and has constant legs pain!\r\nThe exercises they advertise on-line may increase your height\r\ntemporarily for 0,5 - 1 cm, it&#39;s hardly noticeable and does not worth\r\nthe trouble: your height varies during the day on its own.\r\nVery occasionally, surgeons will try an operation to lengthen the\r\nbones in the legs. This is very difficult, and takes many months or\r\neven years, and a series of operations. It is a dreadful operation,\r\nand I mentioned it only because you may have heard of it. Never\r\nconsider mutilating yourself for a miserable increase in height, and\r\nbe happy as you are.", "author_link": "https://answers.yahoo.com/activity/questions?show=ItJzrvQ4aa", "author_name": "ny", "best": "true", "dislikes": "0", "likes": 0, "timestamp": "2012-12-18T03:01:08Z"}, {"answer_content": "While I do not see what the bit approximately ejaculation has to do with something, I am in med tuition and will let you know that the traditional male does not conclude developing till he&#39;s approximately 21 years historical.
