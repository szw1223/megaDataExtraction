But a few years ago, I dropped 15+ lbs just by eating less and working out a few times a week (not very hard at that). I gained those 15lbs back due to stress and life. I&#39;m not worried about losing it, but I&#39;d like to speed up the process a little (better start now, rather than continuing to gain). I work out 5-6 times a week, and have cut back on what I eat... Just not the extent of the first time I lost the 15. \r\n\r\nWould it be more efficient to eat even less than I am, and cut back on working out a little? I&#39;ve been going at this for a month or so and have only lost about 4 lbs, which I fluctuate over. I&#39;m not sure what the problem is. I would really like to get this off, so I am willing to try anything (within reason! And in a healthy manner, of course!)\r\n\r\nAny suggestions?!
