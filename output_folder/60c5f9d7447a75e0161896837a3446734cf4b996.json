I was just sat at the pc when my mum came in and made a comment about my ears looking weird, saying there was a straight line down both of them.. when I looked at them in the mirror theres like a perfect line down the centre of both my ears, half my skin colour, and half red. When I touch them they are very hot and even feel like they are pulsing. My ears are quite naturally red anyway but never hot like this and I find the line part quite strange.\r\n\r\nObviously Im not too worried about this, just curious really.\r\n\r\nAny one else ever had this? What could be the cause?", "question_timestamp": "20081229114020", "followers": 0, "number_of_answers": 1, "categories": ["Health", "Diseases & Conditions", "Skin Conditions"], "answers": [{"answer_content": "Well as long as I&#39;m mad, furious, or a little drunk (cause I never been very drunk and I won&#39;t be) or sick my ears turns red and hot.
