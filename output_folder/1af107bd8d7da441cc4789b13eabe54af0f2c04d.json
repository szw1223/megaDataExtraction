That&#39;s just stupid. That wont make you lose weight, that will make you get muscle. You can&#39;t target fat loss. If you have belly fat, doing crunches and sit ups will not make it go away. Your body loses fat in proportion to everything else. For example, you can&#39;t have no belly fat and have a lot of fat on your legs. It doesn&#39;t work that way. Your body will decide where to take away the fat. The best way to lose weight in a healthy way is to eat about six smaller sized meals a day instead of like three bigger ones. And as for exercises, the best way is to wear sweatpants and a sweatshirt and go running so your body can heat up to the point where it burns calories (fat). Run for about an hour a day (listening to music helps make it seem go faster or run with a friend) Hope you do well, main thing is to stick to the plan and don&#39;t procrastinate.

If you feel like you want to get healthy and feel good, sure, lose a few pounds but do not go below a bmi of 18.5 EVER. \r\nSecondly, losing weight is easy peasy. Just eat healthy foods like wholegrains, fruit, veges and low fat dairy\r\nhere is an example meal plan:\r\nbreakfast: a piece of toast with a boiled/poached egg and a skim milk coffee or tea. If you are used to having butter and can&#39;t eat toast without it, substitute it with avocado or low fat margerine spread.\r\nmorning snack: an apple\r\nLunch: a sandwhich with tuna and salad/ a big green garden salad with beans or tuna or skinless chicken/a can of vegetable soup with a few crackers or a piece of bread\r\nafternoon snack: 10 nuts or a no fat yoghurt or a carrot with hommus or a skim latte\r\nDinner: just a smallish portion of any low fat dinner meal: think sushi, pasta, soup, shepherds pie... whatever! have it with lots of salad because its good for you and will fill you up\r\ndessert: a piece of fruit or a skim milk hot chocolate or a no fat yoghurt\r\n\r\nAlso: if your feeling hungry in between meals munch on cucumber/carrot/celery and drink lots of water, or drink vegetable juice. Beetroot, celery carrot and ginger is so yummy together!!\r\n\r\nBUT REMEMBER: Allow yourself a treat day where you can eat something extra- whatever you want! For example, maybe every friday have a chocolate bar dessert or a piece of cake or a pizza dinner. This way you will have something to really look forward to which will prevent you from binging out of desperation. Just remember to go straight back to your meal plan the next day.\r\n\r\nExcercise: just do 30-40 minutes cardio (bike riding, fast paced walking or jogging) every second day, and in the days in between do strength excercises (sit ups, squats, push ups, leg lifts etc..)\r\n\r\nThis way you will lose weight steadily and surely, and you wont&#39; feel deprived or hungry!!  Once you&#39;ve reached your goal weight just slowly add more healthy food into your meals until your weight stabilises and goes neither up nor down.\r\nHope i helped, good luck :) x", "author_link": "not found", "author_name": "?", "best": "false", "dislikes": "0", "likes": 0, "timestamp": "2011-02-14T21:23:23Z"}, {"answer_content": "the applicable issue you&#39;re able to do on your pal is be supportive no rely what length she is! while/if she is able to lose the burden she could make that determination on her very own. in case you prefer to assist her out in little techniques, take up a interest mutually like biking, walking, rollerblading, etc. or connect a game mutually. the applicable way for an adolescent to drop some weight and get greater healthy is thru exciting activities like activities and being exterior. ingesting healthful meals is likewise important, yet once you&#39;re an adolescent &quot;weight-reduction plan&quot; isn&#39;t needed. merely attempt to shrink out most of the junk. sturdy success!", "author_link": "not found", "author_name": "Anonymous", "best": "false", "dislikes": "0", "likes": 0, "timestamp": "2016-10-04T01:05:00Z"}, {"answer_content": "I lose 70 pounds in grade 8 and I was 5&#39;4 97.
