Ive tried many diets from not eating anything at all, to eating once a day (not a lot of calories), to eating and throwing it back up. I have tried all those.. Now i am trying again the eating once a day (small meal about 500 cal) and somedays nothing. My question is: how do i stay on this diet because sometimes i end up caving and i start to eat little snacks and i feel really guilty about it. Sometimes i get so guilty i think about throwing it back up. Or sometimes i&#39;ll feel bad and decide not to eat anything for almost a week. It usually depends on the mood I&#39;m in that day. Also, does keeping a journal of what i ate help?\r\n Some more info: I&#39;m 4foot9 and weigh 91-94 pounds..My goal is to weigh around 85 pounds.\r\n And also, i do excercise..\r\n Also, ive done everything above for about 4 years..\r\n Thank you for all your answers, i really appreciate them.", "question_timestamp": "20120208152555", "followers": 0, "number_of_answers": 2, "categories": ["Health", "Diet & Fitness"], "answers": [{"answer_content": "You should keep a journal and show it to your doctor, who can send you to a dietician. It is quite obvious you have an eating disorder, because none of the above diets WORK. Eating very little, to nothing at all and then throwing it up is NOT a Diet. It is an eating disorder. You need 3 Meals A Day plus 2 Snacks. Look how little you are getting? Your body will not thank you for it. You are already at the perfect weight for your height. Leave the dieting to those who truly need it. At 85 pounds you will be severely underweight. Talk to your doctor about your eating habits. I am sure he will agree with me.", "author_link": "not found", "author_name": "ChemoAngel", "best": "false", "dislikes": "0", "likes": 0, "timestamp": "2012-02-08T15:29:24Z"}, {"answer_content": "human body needs much much more then that to be healthy.\r\n\r\nhuman BRAIN needs 800-1000 calories a day to FUNCTION PROPERLY\r\n\r\nif you don&#39;t get enough food your brain will use muscle as energy, and when you run out of muscle it will start to use your vital organs as energy and you die (or require liver/kidney transplant). so no that&#39;s a stupid diet don&#39;t risk your health \r\n\r\neating once a day will SLOW your metabolism... the slower your metabolism the fatter you will become \r\n\r\ntry eating a small meal 5-6 times a day for example:\r\n\r\neggs in the morning and whole grain all bran cereal\r\n\r\ntomato, banana, apple, orange and peanuts for meal # 2\r\n\r\nthen for lunch try a small serving of un-breaded roasted/baked chicken with green beans, rice, and a salad\r\n\r\nthen 2 hrs later eat a small meal such as sandwich or burrito\r\n\r\nthen for dinner have anything from pasta, to burrito or anything really as long as its healthy and not fast food you should be fine\r\n\r\neating more often during the day can help your body burn fat because your metabolism will rise and the fats and carbs that you eat will be digested and will not store in your body.\r\n\r\nalso try 30 mins a day of running or go to a gym and do one of those yoga/dance class things they seem pretty fun lots of females enjoy it and it helps you become stronger and healthier as well as reduce stress\r\n\r\ngood luck and please eat more healthy than that please I don&#39;t care if you are under 5 feet tall  thats just not cool my aunt is anorexic and trust me she mentally is a WRECK and has a failing kidney, liver, and high BP, Depression, anxiety, and insomnia so please dont be like her. so just eat healthy exercise  live a happier better life", "author_link": "not found", "author_name": "Josh", "best": "false", "dislikes": "0", "likes": 0, "timestamp": "2012-02-08T16:07:39Z"}], "authorInfor": "none", "last_updata_data": "now"}
