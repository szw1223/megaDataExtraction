Has anyone experienced this before?", "question_content": "My cat bit me today, its in the thumb muscle. I was trying to get him from under the couch. The bite was pretty deep, had to remove cat manually from my hand by prying its mouth open. I washed the wounds out and kept bandages on it, but ended up going to the Doctor. He prescribed me the antibiotic Doxycycline Hyclate for 10 days because it was red and swollen. The redness is starting to go down. Has anyone else had a similar incident. How long does it take to heal, or how can I speed the healing process? I&#39;m just extremely paranoid because of all the terrible things I&#39;ve heard about cat bites.\r\n\r\nI don&#39;t believe any tendons were damaged because the only pain I have is soreness where the sharpest teeth penetrated the skin. I have full movement of my thumb.", "question_timestamp": "20100608154414", "followers": 0, "number_of_answers": 1, "categories": ["Health", "Other - Health"], "answers": [{"answer_content": "youve been to the doctor so you will be fine    assuming you had a tentus injection  the antibiotics are really precetion i had a really bad bite from my cat when she was drugged  after an operation in vets she was confused scared etc   thumb swole up dark purple etc    it  gets sorer as it gets better  so dont worry but if concerned go back to the doctor its very unsual for cats to bite so must have been a really mind and support your kitty  too", "author_link": "https://answers.yahoo.com/activity/questions?show=OcBbjJwvaa", "author_name": "Robert", "best": "true", "dislikes": "0", "likes": 0, "timestamp": "2010-06-08T15:52:56Z"}], "authorInfor": "none", "last_updata_data": "now"}
