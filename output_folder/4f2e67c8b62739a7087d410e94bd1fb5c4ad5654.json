The girl in question has always been naturally skinny/thin even as a child, had to be forced to finish meals, always been a picky eater, stayed the same weight since she was 19 (she is 25 now) even though she&#39;s grown a few inches taller in those years. Her BMI is in the underweight category though not morbidly so (BMI of 17.5). Takes a very long time to eat each meal. Prefers substituting a meal with milkshakes if she can. Carefully avoids junk food but eats anything with a high carb content (rice, pasta, noodles, etc.) and cannot do without milk/curd daily. Occasionally has fainting spells/light headedness (esp. around period time). Does not always feel hungry and can go for hours without eating. Lives by choice a very sedentary lifestyle. \r\nHowever she does not check for calorie content and does not check her weight. The half-yearly weighing check-in is all she knows of her weight, which does not fluctuate too much and has not left the mark it was on five years ago. \r\nShe is not interested in food and would rather do without it and often does until she loses energy and blood sugar drops so low that she faints and becomes nauseated. \r\nWhy so little interest in food?", "question_timestamp": "20110809062602", "followers": 0, "number_of_answers": 3, "categories": ["Health", "Diet & Fitness"], "answers": [{"answer_content": "For anorexia, I would be looking for a poor body image and a desire to lose weight, although there are plenty of other symptoms (see the source below).  In the case of this woman, I would consider other conditions - maybe a thyroid problem - that may reduce appetite or desire to eat.  Medications can also have a similar impact.  Even just dry mouth from medications or allergies can make it undesirable to eat, but drinking something with some calories can get a little nutrition in when dry mouth makes it hard to swallow.\n\nOnly a doctor can really tell what may be going on in this situation, but I really wish her all the best!", "author_link": "https://answers.yahoo.com/activity/questions?show=LN3Pjpoyaa", "author_name": "?", "best": "true", "dislikes": "0", "likes": 0, "timestamp": "2011-08-09T07:27:14Z"}, {"answer_content": "i don&#39;t think this is anorexia. however, it is a dangerous eating pattern. anorexics often weigh themselves daily and are obsessed with the calorie content of foods in an effort to lose weight. \r\nyou are right to be worried about this person though, and ideally she needs to talk to a doctor. due to her age, though, no one can make her go. as far as meal replacements go, milkshakes can have the same calorie content as a regular meal. very little nutritional value except for calcium though. a good way to get in calories and nutrients is eating nuts, because serving sizes are small but pack a lot of healthy fat, fiber, and protein. maybe try to get her to have peanut-butter milkshakes, if possible. or have a couple of almonds every few hours.\r\ngood luck!", "author_link": "none", "author_name": "Anonymous", "best": "false", "dislikes": "0", "likes": 0, "timestamp": "2011-08-09T06:55:12Z"}, {"answer_content": "nicely i actually am very skinny and people make dumb assumptions approximately me being anorexic and that i&#39;m completely positive. the student might have lost a first rate volume of weight. i could in line with possibility talk over with the student approximately anorexia, no longer citing the priority which you think of she may be anorexic, yet merely make a verbal replace ordinarily.", "author_link": "https://answers.yahoo.com/activity/questions?show=LN3Pjpoyaa", "author_name": "?", "best": "false", "dislikes": "0", "likes": 0, "timestamp": "2016-10-18T03:38:42Z"}], "authorInfor": "none", "last_updata_data": "now"}
