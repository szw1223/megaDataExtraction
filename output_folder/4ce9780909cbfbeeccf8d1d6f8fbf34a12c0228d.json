And going through puberty btw...A few years ago, I had intense thoughts about dying one day. I was so scared thinking about it...I was so depressed thinking one day I would not be alive. It went away and then about a year later it came back. Same, depressing thoughts just thinking the same things. Then about 2 years later (6 months ago) I had started to experience gay thoughts and the fear of being gay. It was one of the worst things I have ever went through. It&#39;s funny because during that period of time, I had wished for the death thoughts to come back. Weird huh? I thought that the death scares were way easier to deal with then the stupid sexual orientation thoughts. Well I am over the sexual orientation stuff sort of. Right around when Steve Jobs died I watched some of his speeches involving death and I began to think about death again. I then went to school the next day and thought nothing of it. Maybe a couple weeks later I had my first religious ed class (I&#39;m Christian). The teacher was talking a lot about God and different things and I thought: Wait a second that doesn&#39;t make sense...and I began to question what if there isn&#39;t a God?! And I was so scared and I did talk to my mom about it and I did feel better. She had also mentioned she felt this way when she was younger too. Well now I still cannot get the thought off my mind! I feel like I am arguing with myself. I just am confused about religion and where I will end up. I feel depressed and I just want my normal life back, I am only 13 and young why should I be feeling this way about death!?! Can someone please help me straiten this out!", "question_timestamp": "20111106085801", "followers": 0, "number_of_answers": 3, "categories": ["Health", "Mental Health"], "answers": [{"answer_content": "I KNOWN THAT FEAR IS ALL A ROUND US I THANK ABOUT IT TO BECAUSE WE ALL GOT TO GO ONE DAY BUT I SAY I AM GOING TO LIVE MY LIFE AS NORMAL AS I CAN I MY 35 YEAR OLD SO PEOPLE DO THANK THIS WAY AND I GET SCARED TO GOD SAY LIVE LIFE ONE DAY AT A TIME BECAUSE DEATH AND LIFE IS HERE AND THE DAYS IS NOT HOUR CALL IT GOD  SO LIVE LIFE AS LONG AS YOU CAN WITH NO FEAR PLEASE", "author_link": "https://answers.yahoo.com/activity/questions?show=tKKzO0pQaa", "author_name": "Pamela", "best": "false", "dislikes": "0", "likes": 0, "timestamp": "2011-11-06T09:43:11Z"}, {"answer_content": "What you say you&#39;ve been going through is normal for a growing child.", "author_link": "none", "author_name": "Anonymous", "best": "false", "dislikes": "0", "likes": 0, "timestamp": "2011-11-06T09:03:45Z"}, {"answer_content": "hey uh yeah um yuh kinda have some spellling errors... just saying............ n i think erybudy thinks about those things....=p", "author_link": "none", "author_name": "Anonymous", "best": "false", "dislikes": "0", "likes": 0, "timestamp": "2011-11-06T09:04:19Z"}], "authorInfor": "none", "last_updata_data": "now"}
