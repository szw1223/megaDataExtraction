It\u2019s important to remember that these symptoms can be part of life\u2019s normal lows. But the more symptoms you have, the stronger they are, and the longer they\u2019ve lasted\u2014the more likely it is that you\u2019re dealing with depression. When these symptoms are overwhelming and disabling, that&#39;s when it&#39;s time to seek help.\r\nCommon signs and symptoms of depression\r\n\r\n    Feelings of helplessness and hopelessness. A bleak outlook\u2014nothing will ever get better and there\u2019s nothing you can do to improve your situation.\r\n    Loss of interest in daily activities.  No interest in former hobbies, pastimes, social activities, or sex. You\u2019ve lost your ability to feel joy and pleasure.\r\n    Appetite or weight changes. Significant weight loss or weight gain\u2014a change of more than 5% of body weight in a month.\r\n    Sleep changes. Either insomnia, especially waking in the early hours of the morning, or oversleeping (also known as hypersomnia).\r\n    Anger or irritability. Feeling agitated, restless, or even violent.

An increase in physical complaints such as headaches, back pain, aching muscles, and stomach pain.\r\n\r\nDepression and suicide\r\n\r\nDepression is a major risk factor for suicide. The deep despair and hopelessness that goes along with depression can make suicide feel like the only way to escape the pain. Thoughts of death or suicide are a serious symptom of depression, so take any suicidal talk or behavior seriously. It&#39;s not just a warning sign that the person is thinking about suicide: it&#39;s a cry for help.\r\nWarning signs of suicide include:\r\n\r\n    Talking about killing or harming one\u2019s self\r\n    Expressing strong feelings of hopelessness or being trapped\r\n    An unusual preoccupation with death or dying\r\n    Acting recklessly, as if they have a death wish (e.g. speeding through red lights)\r\n\r\n    Calling or visiting people to say goodbye\r\n    Getting affairs in order (giving away prized possessions, tying up loose ends)\r\n    Saying things like \u201cEveryone would be better off without me\u201d or \u201cI want out\u201d\r\n    A sudden switch from being extremely depressed to acting calm and happy\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you think a friend or family member is considering suicide, express your concern and seek professional help immediately. Talking openly about suicidal thoughts and feelings can save a life.", "author_link": "not found", "author_name": "Ryno Adlam", "best": "false", "dislikes": "0", "likes": 0, "timestamp": "2011-11-08T21:19:57Z"}], "authorInfor": "none", "last_updata_data": "now"}
