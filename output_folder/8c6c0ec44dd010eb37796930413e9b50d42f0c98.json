I&#39;ve been on medication for almost 10 years now (I&#39;m 30) and I can honestly tell you that I don&#39;t know what my life would be like if I hadn&#39;t gotten on my meds!!!  They help me tremendously!  It&#39;s like night and day, seriously!  \r\n\r\nI was blessed to have had good luck with finding a medicine that helped me early on.  I know some of my relatives haven&#39;t been so fortunate and are still struggling to find one that works.  Although it makes me feel better, I still have rough days... such is life!  \r\n\r\nAlso, you have to weigh the side effects of the medication.  It depends on how much you need to level out the seratonin in your brain.  Some need a higher dosage than others because we are all different.  Sometimes I feel like I need a higher dosage when my hormones are raging, like when I&#39;m pregnant.  I usually take 20 mg of Celexa on a daily basis and have for the last 10 years.  You&#39;d need to consult a physician and be under a doctor&#39;s care!", "author_link": "not found", "author_name": "Stacy", "best": "false", "dislikes": "0", "likes": 0, "timestamp": "2009-07-22T03:58:49Z"}, {"answer_content": "To be honest, they didn&#39;t do much for me. \r\nI&#39;ve met people who told me they did help.\r\n\r\nOdds are you will spend months trying different medications at different dosages.
