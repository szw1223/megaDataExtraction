I eat a lot of food from afternoon till late night. Since then i started to eating healthy and run a lot and i weigh 174lb now. i don&#39;t know what to do to lower my enzyme and im scared that it will get worse.", "question_timestamp": "20120121221711", "followers": 0, "number_of_answers": 3, "categories": ["Health", "Diseases & Conditions", "Other - Diseases"], "answers": [{"answer_content": "A single lab test has no diagnostic value.  If the elevation of the &quot;enzyme&quot; is a general marker for &quot;growth of new tissue&quot; like alpha fetoprotein or a specific organ enzyme, which all are not normal in the blood and their elevation indicates cell damage with that enzyme leaking, like gamma-GT of the liver: it is always the marker for the disease not the disease itself. You can&#39;t and mustn&#39;t cure the lab value but the disease which is indicated by it. The ultrasound diagnostic and CT scans don&#39;t show lab values but solid structures. You don&#39;t say if there was anything positive or nothing was found. If both were negative your labs have to be controlled. There are many reasons for false positive lab results. Alpha fetoprotein for example is highest in pregnancy, that&#39;s where it has its name from. In men it is sometimes &quot;elevated&quot; because the sample was confused on its way to/from the lab or in the lab itself, because men take male/female hormones for body building, &quot; gender changing&quot; or for whatever other reasons. \r\nLab values in addition are &quot;normed&quot; to te mean value of the normal population plus minus one standard deviation. Some people have their own normal value being far outside that range without having any disease. It is a tragic error to try to &quot;normalize&quot; those values because that would indicate a pathological situation in those people.\r\nLong story short: If only your lab is deranged, both diagnostics of solid tumors negative,the lab must be controlled a few times regarding the tendency. If increasing, CT and ultrasound repeated and NMR added, other sources excluded (like external  intoxication), if decreasing: regular controls with increasing timely delay.\r\nIf one of the CT / Ultrasonic diagnostics was positive: forget the lab value. Alterations have no diagnostic value. Any &quot;normalization&quot; is self deception as long as the solid structure is not gone or has been  removed.", "author_link": "https://answers.yahoo.com/activity/questions?show=i9sH5VKvaa", "author_name": "?", "best": "true", "dislikes": "0", "likes": 1, "timestamp": "2012-01-21T22:45:10Z"}, {"answer_content": "you need to be more specific,what enzyme is it?\r\nLiver enzymes?\r\nAST?
