Take them long enough, and your body will get used to the meds, and the pain may not go away. That could be why your meds are only working for 6 months.\r\nI have been off work for 2 years because of migraines and a migraine related stroke, but have suffered migraines since I was a child. I have tried every medication imaginable, and up until November &#39;05 was on a Duragesic 100 patch (this medication was 80x more powerful than morphine, and in the end still was not doing the trick). I have been in the ER still suffering after receiving over 300cc&#39;s of Demerol, and thought nothing would ever help.\r\nI went to a new Neurologist who told me to get off of the analgesics, be it Tylenol, Ibuprofen, or Rx drugs. He also took me off of Ametriptaline and Serataline.\r\nIt was hell when I did get a migraine, as I couldn&#39;t take anything, and had to &quot;suffer through the pain&quot;, but I have been headache free for the past month. I know that doesn&#39;t seem long, but I can&#39;t remember the last time I&#39;ve gone this long without pain.", "author_link": "not found", "author_name": "Duncarin", "best": "true", "dislikes": "0", "likes": 1, "timestamp": "2006-07-16T23:53:55Z"}, {"answer_content": "I had migraines as a toddler from what my parents say. Migraines are not your typical headache. People often confuse a bad headache for a migraine. Migraines are a disease.  I don&#39;t like hospitals. I&#39;m not fond of drugs. I take Midrin (available by rx only). Did you try Imitrex? Ok,  I stopped smoking, eating chocolate, meat, some dairy. These are someone known cause for migraines. Or its just in the genes. Drink plenty of water and get a full 8 hours sleep every night if possible. Take short walks get some air. If you get naucious, try sucking on a piece of fireball candy. All this helped me. Hope it does the same for you.", "author_link": "not found", "author_name": "mar", "best": "false", "dislikes": "0", "likes": 0, "timestamp": "2006-07-14T12:17:28Z"}, {"answer_content": "Your migraines could be a sign of something really serious (besides stress and anxiety). Try drinking black tea and yoga. It relaxes your mind, body, and soul. I would also suggest seeing your Primary Health Care Provider if your migraines get worse. I was diagnosed with severe migraines years ago and placed on medication (basically a high dose of Excedrin). I stopped the pills, got rid of the people who brought negativity to my life, started exercising, and I haven&#39;t got a migraine since then. GOOD LUCK!

The caffeine should help.  Eat a banana because of the potassium.  Wear sunglasses outside and don&#39;t have really bright lightbulbs in the house because that can make the migraine worse.  I&#39;m guessing you&#39;ve already tried Imitrex.  That works for my mom.  Make sure you are getting enough sleep on a comfortable pillow and bed.  Try to resolve some stress issues that can be causing it.  Sometimes just accomplishing one simple task can help.
