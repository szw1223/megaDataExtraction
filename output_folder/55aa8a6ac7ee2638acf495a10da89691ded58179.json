I do get red shoulders and I can&#39;t see my feet when I look down, but I&#39;m kind of used to it.\r\n\r\nI mean, I&#39;m used to my boobs since I was a 36D when I was 13, but I&#39;m wondering if my mom&#39;s right. She wouldn&#39;t have me do it until I was 18, but is she overreacting since she doesn&#39;t get it?

I&#39;m actually pretty sure that many girls with big breasts like us can&#39;t see them, and if they can, they can probably just see their toes.\r\n\r\nDo not get a breast reduction just to please your mother. You should do it to please yourself. Also you might end up with a botched surgery and then have terrible looking breasts.\r\n\r\nI would have to say that your mother is over reacting to your breast size, she is on the smaller scale. The average for american women ( i don&#39;t know if you are american) is a 36 C. But womens breast are going to be the size that they are going to be. Heridity does have a part in deciding what size you will have, but usually its just a surprise.\r\n\r\nI&#39;m the first big breasted woman in my family since my great great great grandma.", "author_link": "none", "author_name": "Anonymous", "best": "true", "dislikes": "0", "likes": 1, "timestamp": "2010-02-09T17:21:47Z"}, {"answer_content": "My mother is 5&#39; and 110 pounds.

It sound&#39;s ridiculous, but I have actually seen that happen.
