And they secretly suspect they may have to answer to a living God for it.  They&#39;re scared to death.\r\n\r\nYou don&#39;t fix a situation created by someone not on top of his game by putting in an incompetent crook.  And you don&#39;t fix a situation created by idiots like Fred Phelps and the Westboro Baptist Church, or mindless missionaries who don&#39;t stop to think about whether they are offering &quot;the natives&quot; something of value to replace what their ancestors believed, by condemning ALL religious believers.  That just weakens our society by abolishing our moral compass.\r\n\r\nTo the moron who said &quot;Hitler was a Christian&quot; - no, he was NOT.  He persecuted church after church for defending the Jews, and then created a &quot;German Church&quot; that had no Old Testament and no Christ.  Himmler, his minister of the interior, tried to abolish Christianity entirely and replace it with Odinism.

Brit Hume just said Tiger Woods should convert to Christianity from Buddism. Religion in general has been responsible for more human suffering than anything else. The crusades, where the pope said basically, &#39;Kill them all and let God sort them out&quot;, is just one example. Hitler was another Christian that didn&#39;t think other religions had a right to exist. I know Islam is known for religious intolerance and rightly so, but  some of todays Christians are just as bad. They believe it&#39;s okay to kill people they think are sinners, like abortion clinic workers. They think gays are beneath contempt, and would love nothing better than to wipe them out as well.

All Abrahamic religions have been used to justify violence and all contain acts of violence in their holy books.\r\n\r\nIn the 1830&#39;s the christian bible was used by some in congressional debate to show why slavery was socially correct, thankfully we are beyond that today.\r\n\r\nAnyone, no matter their political stance, can find something in any holy work to justify their own personal feelings, beliefs and even prejudices - and that means democrats, republicans and independents.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"genaddt"},"dateCreated":"2010-01-09T19:54:36Z","upvoteCount":5},{"@type":"Answer","text":"Our Constitution prohibits the promotion of one religion as a state religion.\r\nTalk to the founders who had seen what religion had done to Europe.\r\nThere is no question, that slavery was not only mentioned in the Bible, but that the statutes that ensure fair treatments to slaves were talked about in churchs as a responsibilty for people to care for what they saw as a slightly less than human African.  That gays were to be thought of as bad is also in the Bible, a phrase that states a man shall not lie with another man as he would lie with a woman, and again when Lot offers his virgin daughters to a mob so that they don&#39;t commit the worse act of lying with a man.

Brit Hume just said Tiger Woods should convert to Christianity from Buddism. Religion in general has been responsible for more human suffering than anything else. The crusades, where the pope said basically, &#x27;Kill them all and let God sort them out&quot;, is just one example. Hitler was another Christian that didn&#x27;t think other religions had a right to exist. I know Islam is known for religious intolerance and rightly so, but  some of todays Christians are just as bad. They believe it&#x27;s okay to kill people they think are sinners, like abortion clinic workers. They think gays are beneath contempt, and would love nothing better than to wipe them out as well. You should really educate yourself before you go making statements that have no basis in fact.</p></div><div class="AnswerActionBar__answerActionBarWrap___bd9es"><div class="AnswerActionBar__answerActionBar___1LrM2"><div class="AnswerActionBar__left___5SkAf"><button class="Buttons__linkBtn___1gAIw Buttons__btnBase___2Z659 Buttons__withIcon___3aIam" disabled="" aria-disabled="true" aria-label="Thumbs up for this answer." tabindex="-1"><svg class="Cur(p)" width="24" style="fill:#6e7780;stroke:#6e7780;stroke-width:0;vertical-align:bottom" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" data-icon="thumb-up"><path d="M23 10.9c0-1.6-1.6-2.6-3.2-2.6h-4.5c.4-1.1.5-2.5.3-4.1-.2-1.7-1.3-2.9-2.7-3.1-1.5-.2-2.8.6-2.8 2.1.1 1.3-.4 2.2-1.5 3.5-.1 0-.2.2-.4.3-.5.6-1.2 1.2-1.8 1.7l-.5.5H2.1c-.6 0-1.1.4-1.1 1V22c0 .5.5 1 1.1 1h4.2c.6 0 1.1-.4 1.1-1h10.8c1.4 0 2.7-.9 2.7-2.5 0-.4-.1-.8-.2-1.1.6-.4 1-1 1-1.7 0-.4-.1-.8-.3-1.1.6-.4 1-1 1-1.8 0-.4-.1-.8-.2-1.1.4-.5.8-1.1.8-1.8zm-2.7 2.6zM5.2 21H3.1v-9.9h2.1V21zm13-1H7.4v-9.4c.2-.1.3-.3.5-.4.6-.6 1.3-1.2 1.9-1.9.2-.1.3-.3.5-.5 1.4-1.6 2-3 2-4.8 0 0 0-.1.3 0 .5.1.9.5 1 1.4.3 2.1-.2 3.7-.6 4.1-.8.6-.3 1.7.7 1.7h6.2c.6 0 1.1.4 1.1.7s-.5.7-.6.7c-1.4 0-1.4 1.8-.1 2 0 .1.1.2.1.3s0 .2-.2.2c-.2.1-.4.1-.6.1-1.2 0-1.5 1.5-.4 1.9l.2.2c.2.1.2.3.2.5 0 .1-.1.1-.3.2-.2.1-.4.2-.6.2-1.1.1-1.2 1.6-.1 1.9l.1.1s.2.2.2.4c-.2.3-.4.4-.7.4z"></path></svg><span>3</span></button><button class="Buttons__linkBtn___1gAIw Buttons__btnBase___2Z659 Buttons__withIcon___3aIam" disabled="" aria-disabled="true" aria-label="Thumbs down for this answer." tabindex="-1"><svg class="Cur(p)" width="24" style="fill:#6e7780;stroke:#6e7780;stroke-width:0;vertical-align:bottom" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" data-icon="thumb-down"><path d="M1 13.1c0 1.6 1.6 2.6 3.2 2.6h4.5c-.4 1.1-.5 2.5-.3 4.1.2 1.7 1.3 2.9 2.7 3.1 1.5.2 2.8-.6 2.8-2.1-.1-1.3.4-2.2 1.5-3.5.1-.2.3-.3.4-.5.6-.6 1.2-1.2 1.8-1.7.2-.2.4-.3.6-.5H22c.6 0 1.1-.4 1.1-1V2c0-.5-.5-1-1.1-1h-4.2c-.6 0-1.1.4-1.1 1H5.9c-1.4 0-2.7.9-2.7 2.5 0 .4.1.8.2 1.1-.6.4-1 1-1 1.7 0 .4.1.8.3 1.1-.6.4-1 1-1 1.8 0 .4.1.8.2 1.1-.5.5-.9 1.1-.9 1.8zm2.7-2.6zM18.8 3h2.1v9.9h-2.1V3zm-13 1H16.6v9.4c-.2.1-.3.3-.5.4-.7.6-1.3 1.2-1.9 1.8l-.5.5c-1.4 1.6-2 3-2 4.8 0 0 0 .1-.3 0-.5-.1-.9-.5-1-1.4-.3-2.1.2-3.7.6-4.1.8-.6.3-1.7-.7-1.7H4.2c-.6 0-1.1-.4-1.1-.7s.5-.7.6-.7c1.4 0 1.4-1.8.1-2 0-.1-.1-.2-.1-.3s0-.2.2-.2c.2-.1.4-.1.6-.1 1.2.2 1.6-1.3.5-1.7l-.2-.2c-.2-.1-.3-.3-.3-.5 0-.1.1-.1.3-.2.2-.1.5-.2.6-.2 1.1-.1 1.2-1.6.1-1.9l-.1-.1s-.1-.2-.1-.4c0-.4.2-.5.5-.5z"></path></svg><span>2</span></button></div><div class="AnswerActionBar__right___nWVBY"><button class="Buttons__linkBtn___1gAIw Buttons__btnBase___2Z659 Buttons__withIcon___3aIam" disabled="" aria-disabled="true" aria-label="Report abuse." tabindex="-1"><svg class="Cur(p)" width="24" style="fill:#6e7780;stroke:#6e7780;stroke-width:0;vertical-align:bottom" height="24" viewBox="0 0 48 48" data-icon="flag"><path d="M40 10H28.62l-2.888-5-.008.004C25.38 4.407 24.74 4 24 4H8c-1.105 0-2 .896-2 2v36c0 1.105.895 2 2 2s2-.895 2-2V28h12.846l2.887 5c.357.62 1.018 1 1.732 1H40c1.105 0 2-.895 2-2V12c0-1.104-.895-2-2-2zm-2 20h-9.38l-2.888-5c-.357-.617-1.018-1-1.732-1H10V8h12.845l2.887 5c.37.642 1.04 1 1.732 1H38v16z"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></li><li><div class="Answer__answer___FdhNY"><div class="Answer__answerer___ZcKj-"><div class="UserProfile__container___1AkWy"><div class="UserProfile__profileWrapper___2XpWd" style="cursor:pointer"><div class="UserProfile__avatar___2gI-3"><a href="/activity/questions?show=AA11430900" aria-label="Visit genaddt&#x27;s profile page."><img src="https://s.yimg.com/dh/ap/social/profile/profile_b48.png" alt="genaddt&#x27;s avatar" aria-hidden="true"/></a></div><div class="UserProfile__userInfo___PiPKv"><a class="UserProfile__userName___1d1RW" href="/activity/questions?show=AA11430900">genaddt</a><div class="LevelBadge__levelBadge___2GjGv"><span>Lv <!-- -->7</span></div></div></div><div class="UserProfile__childrenWrapper___2A5yC"><div class="Answer__subtitle___23J6D">1 decade ago</div></div></div></div><div class="ExpandableContent__content___2Iw4v" style="max-height:120px"><p>Most people won&#x27;t generalize like your question alludes to; most christians just practice their religion and leave others be but there are others who actively seek to change peoples religious beliefs whether they wish to or not.

And you don&#x27;t fix a situation created by idiots like Fred Phelps and the Westboro Baptist Church, or mindless missionaries who don&#x27;t stop to think about whether they are offering \&quot;the natives\&quot; something of value to replace what their ancestors believed, by condemning ALL religious believers.  That just weakens our society by abolishing our moral compass.\r\n\r\nTo the moron who said \&quot;Hitler was a Christian\&quot; - no, he was NOT.  He persecuted church after church for defending the Jews, and then created a \&quot;German Church\&quot; that had no Old Testament and no Christ.  Himmler, his minister of the interior, tried to abolish Christianity entirely and replace it with Odinism.

Brit Hume just said Tiger Woods should convert to Christianity from Buddism. Religion in general has been responsible for more human suffering than anything else. The crusades, where the pope said basically, &#x27;Kill them all and let God sort them out\&quot;, is just one example. Hitler was another Christian that didn&#x27;t think other religions had a right to exist. I know Islam is known for religious intolerance and rightly so, but  some of todays Christians are just as bad. They believe it&#x27;s okay to kill people they think are sinners, like abortion clinic workers. They think gays are beneath contempt, and would love nothing better than to wipe them out as well.

That gays were to be thought of as bad is also in the Bible, a phrase that states a man shall not lie with another man as he would lie with a woman, and again when Lot offers his virgin daughters to a mob so that they don&#x27;t commit the worse act of lying with a man.

But being a Christian and quite gullible will probably leave you in denial to what is blatantly obvious.  \r\n\r\nPerhaps it is also a black spot on the missionaries records to only provide help to people who are willing to convert, while at the same time trying to cut those converts off from the rest of their family.\r\n\r\nWorst yet, is the social conservatives stance on trying to enforce their religious views on all by use of law, while at the same time being hypocrites and crying that the left tries to make a nanny state.&quot;,&quot;attachedImageUrl&quot;:null,&quot;attachedImageId&quot;:null,&quot;reference&quot;:null,&quot;answerer&quot;:{&quot;euid&quot;:&quot;7bXNmXAIn1zbI09nAIGWOlokvDej7M1yecv3nrqlug--&quot;,&quot;kid&quot;:&quot;Z92LPUqaaa&quot;,&quot;nickname&quot;:&quot;Green&quot;,&quot;imageUrl&quot;:&quot;https://s.yimg.com/ag/images/4516/37914181550_b5a9e2_128sq.jpg&quot;,&quot;level&quot;:7},&quot;isBestAnswer&quot;:false,&quot;thumbsDown&quot;:3,&quot;thumbsUp&quot;:2,&quot;isAnonymous&quot;:false,&quot;commentCount&quot;:0,&quot;createdTime&quot;:&quot;2010-01-09T19:54:20Z&quot;,&quot;userAnswerRelation&quot;:{&quot;hasFlagged&quot;:false,&quot;canFlag&quot;:true,&quot;canVote&quot;:false,&quot;canChooseBestAnswer&quot;:false,&quot;hasVoted&quot;:false,&quot;isAuthor&quot;:false,&quot;hasCommented&quot;:false,&quot;canComment&quot;:true}},{&quot;qid&quot;:&quot;20100109194654AAaoSxn&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;7QPXV_5Px1raxZ1tZyMBgtIsnombN9EDq7Kok4J_qaSFvUTB9EwJKGo=&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Jerry Falwell and Liberty University\r\nPat Robertson and the 700 Club\r\n\r\nBoth of them were on Meet the Press after 9/11 and said that God allowed it to happen because America had become tolerant of homosexuals and feminists.

It certainly can't be based on the beliefs of the founding fathers which were widely varied.  \r\n\r\n\"In recent decades Christian advocacy groups, prompted by motives that have been questioned by some, have felt a powerful urge to enlist the Founding Fathers in their respective congregations. But recovering the spiritual convictions of the Founders, in all their messy integrity, is not an easy task. Once again, diversity is the dominant pattern. Franklin and Jefferson were deists, Washington harbored a pantheistic sense of providential destiny, John Adams began a Congregationalist and ended a Unitarian, Hamilton was a lukewarm Anglican for most of his life but embraced a more actively Christian posture after his son died in a duel.\r\n\r\nOne quasi-religious conviction they all shared, however, was a discernible obsession with living on in the memory of posterity. One reason the modern editions of their papers are so monstrously large is that most of the Founders were compulsively fastidious about preserving every scrap of paper they wrote or received, all as part of a desire to leave a written record that would assure their secular immortality in the history books. (When John Adams and Jefferson discussed the possibility of a more conventional immortality, they tended to describe heaven as a place where they could resume their ongoing argument on earth.) Adams, irreverent to the end, declared that, if it could ever be demonstrated conclusively that no future state existed, his advice to every man, woman, and child was to “take opium.” The only afterlife which they considered certain was in the memory of subsequent generations, which is to say us. \"\r\n\r\nhttp://www.britannica.com/blogs/2007/02/the-us-founding-fathers-their-religious-beliefs/\r\n\r\nChristian Terrorists:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOxEa4mkPik\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lvU-DislkI\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ms2Tu-4AHL8\r\n\r\n\"Christian Fundamentalist Terrorism.\r\nIt's shocking to write. But it's time to start calling it what it is.\r\n\r\nWhen Jim D. Adkisson walked into the Tennessee Valley Unitarian Universalist Church with 76 rounds and a shot-gun, he killed 2 people and was charged with murder. His motive was \"he hated the liberal movement\" and was upset with \"liberals in general as well as gays.\" He should have been charged with terrorism.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.huffingtonpost.com/shannyn-moore/christian-fundamentalist_b_209521.html\r\n\r\n\r\nThe majority of anti-abortion violence committed in the United States of America has been perpetrated by fundamentalist right wing Christians.  Currently, the United States has the highest incidence of anti-abortion violence than any other country, \r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-abortion_violence_in_the_United_States#United_States\r\n\r\nNotorious Christian terrorist Eric Rudolph was sentenced to two life terms on Monday. The one-time fugitive had carried out four bombings that terrorized the southeastern areas of the United States. Among his crimes were the blowing up of an abortion clinic in Birmingham, Alabama, which killed a policeman, and a bombing of the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta, Georgia.\r\n\r\n“God sent the shooter,” the signs wielded by anti-abortion protestors at the funeral of slain doctor George Tiller proclaimed.  Last week’s assassination of abortion provider and feminist George Tiller in a Kansas church on the so-called holy seventh day was not only a barbaric act of religious cowardice but a terrorist assault on the rights of women.  Tragically similar to the 1998 murder of New York doctor Bernard Slepian, Tiller’s murder was the culmination of years of attempted murders, death threats, bombings and arson attacks waged against abortion providers by white Christian terrorists.\r\n\r\nMurders\r\nIn the U.S., violence directed toward abortion providers has killed at least eight people, including four doctors, two clinic employees, a security guard, and a clinic escort.[5]\r\n\r\nMarch 10, 1993: Dr. David Gunn of Pensacola, Florida was fatally shot during a protest. He had been the subject of wanted-style posters distributed by Operation Rescue in the summer of 1992. Michael F. Griffin was found guilty of Dr. Gunn's murder and was sentenced to life in prison. \r\nJuly 29, 1994: Dr. John Britton and James Barrett, a clinic escort, were both shot to death outside of another facility in Pensacola. Rev. Paul Jennings Hill was charged with the killings. Hill received a death sentence and was executed September 3, 2003. \r\nDecember 30, 1994: Two receptionists, Shannon Lowney and Lee Ann Nichols, were killed in two clinic attacks in Brookline, Massachusetts. John Salvi, who prior to his arrest was distributing pamphlets from Human Life International,[6] was arrested and confessed to the killings. He died in prison and guards found his body under his bed with a plastic garbage bag tied around his head. Salvi had also confessed to a non-lethal attack in Norfolk, Virginia days before the Brookline killings. \r\nJanuary 29, 1998: Robert Sanderson, an off-duty police officer who worked as a security guard at an abortion clinic in Birmingham, Alabama, was killed when his workplace was bombed. Eric Robert Rudolph, who was also responsible for the 1996 Centennial Olympic Park bombing, was charged with the crime and received two life sentences as a result. \r\nOctober 23, 1998: Dr. Barnett Slepian was shot to death at his home in Amherst, New York. His was the last in a series of similar shootings against providers in Canada and northern New York state which were all likely committed by James Kopp. Kopp was convicted of Dr. Slepian's murder after finally being apprehended in France in 2001. \r\nMay 31, 2009: Dr. George Tiller was shot and killed as he served as an usher at his church in Wichita, Kansas.[7] \r\nAnother doctor, George Patterson, was shot and killed in Mobile, Alabama on August 21, 1993, but it is uncertain whether his death was the direct result of his profession or rather a robbery.[8] [9] \r\n\r\nAttempted murder, assault, and threats\r\nAccording to statistics gathered by the National Abortion Federation (NAF), an organization of abortion providers, since 1977 in the United States and Canada, there have been 17 attempted murders, 383 death threats, 153 incidents of assault or battery, and 3 kidnappings committed against abortion providers.[10] The attempted murders were:[5][11][12]","attachedImageUrl":null,"attachedImageId":null,"reference":null,"isBestAnswer":false,"thumbsDown":1,"thumbsUp":3,"isAnonymous":true,"commentCount":0,"createdTime":"2010-01-09T20:16:34Z","userAnswerRelation":{"hasFlagged":false,"canFlag":true,"canVote":false,"canChooseBestAnswer":false,"hasVoted":false,"isAuthor":false,"hasCommented":false,"canComment":true}},{"qid":"20100109194654AAaoSxn","id":"akgoO79Px1pGB0SEqO57dyNRevxkLT_DfzsNDmel-dl0YRpBz9FB7GU=","text":"Libs will blame you for the crusades.","attachedImageUrl":null,"attachedImageId":null,"reference":null,"answerer":{"euid":"hXjrz0B5gFBCBZ94VoxDNahujYjZgSjTdb7d9jkgJw--","kid":"kxU0gpdAaa","nickname":"Liberal Madness","imageUrl":"https://s.yimg.com/ag/images/4560/37416717853_780e18_128sq.jpg","level":5},"isBestAnswer":false,"thumbsDown":3,"thumbsUp":3,"isAnonymous":false,"commentCount":0,"createdTime":"2010-01-09T19:50:43Z","userAnswerRelation":{"hasFlagged":false,"canFlag":true,"canVote":false,"canChooseBestAnswer":false,"hasVoted":false,"isAuthor":false,"hasCommented":false,"canComment":true}},{"qid":"20100109194654AAaoSxn","id":"q2MrVhVPx1pxNG4xNCpfgLaSOcusPWOSRrY3lxWawUe-_9buEnAOxDc=","text":"Because they can't handle the Truth.","attachedImageUrl":null,"attachedImageId":null,"reference":null,"answerer":{"euid":"UCoRFcMJm0LHoXaFumb9dg5uq7SQ2Xx5OiwkE4Xmwg--","kid":"APTvuBREaa","nickname":"*ew","imageUrl":"https://s.yimg.com/ag/images/default_user_profile_pic_128sq.jpg","level":3},"isBestAnswer":false,"thumbsDown":3,"thumbsUp":6,"isAnonymous":false,"commentCount":0,"createdTime":"2010-01-09T19:50:39Z","userAnswerRelation":{"hasFlagged":false,"canFlag":true,"canVote":false,"canChooseBestAnswer":false,"hasVoted":false,"isAuthor":false,"hasCommented":false,"canComment":true}},{"qid":"20100109194654AAaoSxn","id":"tfQ4reNPx1pNcrHnhfClFdS_B8xYrkOd610O0Z_z4sHfudYSlU4Qtbk=","text":"And yet you do the same thing to Muslims.","attachedImageUrl":null,"attachedImageId":null,"reference":null,"isBestAnswer":false,"thumbsDown":4,"thumbsUp":4,"isAnonymous":true,"commentCount":0,"createdTime":"2010-01-09T19:51:12Z","userAnswerRelation":{"hasFlagged":false,"canFlag":true,"canVote":false,"canChooseBestAnswer":false,"hasVoted":false,"isAuthor":false,"hasCommented":false,"canComment":true}},{"qid":"20100109194654AAaoSxn","id":"1yHYRJZPx1qMJYBTLC7eD4hPJKBltYACzoueZA6mRI-s_NDiD9jYvu8=","text":"Cultural Marxism -
