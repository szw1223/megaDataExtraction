Sound familiar...most of you seem to \&quot;ignore\&quot; it... so to conclude, the bible says good deeds and helping others will get you into heaven.\r\n\r\n\r\nYes Jesus says \&quot;No man can come by the father but by me\&quot; but he also said \&quot;forgive them father, for they know NOT what they do\&quot; and those who do NOT believe think that Jesus is some made up charecter and so they do NOT know they are actually rejecting the son of god...they will be forgiven for not knowing...jesus said it.

How will you EVER know that you have done enough good, or if it will balance out the bad?\r\n\r\nThe truth is, before you accept Jesus as Savior, none of your good deeds are taken in to account, only the sin you have committed in violation to the law. After you accept Jesus as your Savior, your sins are deleted from the record and only the good you do in the Spirit remains.

You are taking aspects of scripture, and trying to interpret them according to your own understanding.  The bible says also in 1 Corinthians 2:14 says that the naturaly man does not understand the things of the spirit; for they are spiritually discerned. \r\nWe have to look at the whole counsel of God.  Yes, Jesus said that he was going to separate the sheep and the goats, but you left out the part that says this:  the \"Righteous\" will answer him, and say, \" 'LORD', when did we see thee naked and clothe thee....\" \r\n\r\nSo, Jesus was referring to people who were 1. righteous and 2. who acknowledged him (the Son of Man, Jesus) as  being Lord.  My point here is that there is no proof that he is talking to people that do not claim to be Christians.  Though i do admit that God is the judge.  \r\n\r\nAlso, the second group of people who go to eternal damnation might have actually been so-called Christians.\r\n\r\nPeople will  be lost for rejecting Christ.  Yes, it is true that Jesus prayed for the Father to forgive.  But what does that really mean? The Bible says \"To wit, that God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them; and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation.\" I Corinthians 5:19 (he does not \"ascribe\" or put those sins on our account).  Why?  because the  Bible also says that He who knew no sin became sin for us; that we might become the righteousness of  God through Him.\" And even though God did not impute our sins (because of Jesus work on the cross), we still must COME TO JESUS CHRIST:  for the next verse says:  \r\n \r\n20Now then we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech you by us: we pray you in Christ's stead, be ye reconciled to God.\r\n\r\nSo, though God does not hold your sins against  you, you still must be reconciled to God through Christ.  The next verse says:\r\n\r\n 21For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.\r\n\r\n(He, who knew no sin became sin for us.  It is not saying that WE knew no sin-- for all have sinned and come short of the glory of God.  Romans 3:23)\r\n\r\nSo, we see that people are made righteous through him.  And in the passage that you refer to in your question (the separating of the sheep from the goats), it says that the sheep are the righteous.  So, how can a man say he is righteous without Christ?\r\n\r\nWhy take the chance?  Come to Christ now, and be reconciled to God.","attachedImageUrl":null,"attachedImageId":null,"reference":null,"answerer":{"euid":"9QuOH.IOiF9xhl_iZswdX_ImXLSQxnRarFHTibgOzA--","kid":"a34b121ebdd2bee61baba61f9caa870faa","nickname":"joy'nim","imageUrl":"https://s.yimg.com/ag/images/4564/24432398418_a2a952_128sq.jpg","level":2},"isBestAnswer":false,"thumbsDown":0,"thumbsUp":0,"isAnonymous":false,"commentCount":0,"createdTime":"2007-05-04T19:45:44Z","userAnswerRelation":{"hasFlagged":false,"canFlag":true,"canVote":false,"canChooseBestAnswer":false,"hasVoted":false,"isAuthor":false,"hasCommented":false,"canComment":true}},{"qid":"20070504185838AAZPCC1","id":"Xg3g-qtPx1pkXltQ7dXAnccEZ3RIfiQ9IawFLPUGzGRGrGjIUjqBY1xn_QG9CBE_Y9UFzHbjAJ8Gz8p2xHrLMnQ=","text":"I agree with this statement\r\n\r\nRead Ephesians 2:8-9, we are saved by grace.
