Make the chrisitians and the jews convert and pay a tax&quot;. (rough paraphrase sorry).\r\n\r\nSome people say that&#39;s because of defense, but honestly.  That completely contradicts the previous statement. But it&#39;s all within the same Surah.\r\n\r\nI think this &quot;no compulsion in religion&quot; thing is nothing more than a Trojan Horse.\r\n\r\nThe crusades were a big part of why the west isn&#39;t muslim.\r\n\r\nLook at places like Armenian where some 2 million christians were slaughtered.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Anonymous"},"dateCreated":"2006-12-17T05:48:42Z","upvoteCount":2},"suggestedAnswer":[{"@type":"Answer","text":"Islam can not be forced on someone.

The big three are Christianity, Islam, and Buddhism. At times, followers of all these religions have behaved pretty badly, using violence and political pressure to convert new followers.\r\n\r\nOther religions, such as Judaism and Hinduism are not nearly as &quot;evangelical&quot; about finding new followers, although there are exceptions, such as the Kabbalah and Hare Krishna movements.\r\n\r\nANd for the record, Muslims have historically considered Jews and Christians (and Zoroastrians, I think) as &quot;People of the Book&quot; and granted them more rights than people of other faiths.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Mr. Bad Day"},"dateCreated":"2006-12-17T13:42:31Z","upvoteCount":1},{"@type":"Answer","text":"I do not know where you get this idea. I have many Muslim friends and not once did they try to force their beliefs on me. Now i cannot say that for a lot of other religions: Jehovah Witnesses who ring my doorbell at 9 on Sunday morning is one very good example!\r\nI will even put it more strongly: I have a great interest in Islam and are considering to convert. Not ONCE did ANY of my Muslim friends &#39;feed&#39; me with their religion, even after i made it known. They just told me they were happy that i was doing my research and that hopefully, i would decide to convert and that i was always more than welcome to ask them any questions i had. \r\nThis made me feel even more secure and warm!\r\nTiff","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"The REAL Tiffy!"},"dateCreated":"2006-12-17T13:56:54Z","upvoteCount":2},{"@type":"Answer","text":"I wish you would have answered my question about islam.

Also, Mormons and Jehovah&#39;s Witnesses routinely go door to door to try to persuade people to follow their religions.\r\n\r\nBut not everyone in those religions does it.

However, Muslims do teach Islam  to others; we don&#x27;t force it.  Other religions also do teach about their religion. I mean seriously, how can a religion be forced. You can be taught but nobody is changing what you really think except yourself because you decide whether you want to be of that religion. The people who teach aren&#x27;t deciding for you.</p></div><div class="AnswerActionBar__answerActionBarWrap___bd9es"><div class="AnswerActionBar__answerActionBar___1LrM2"><div class="AnswerActionBar__left___5SkAf"><button class="Buttons__linkBtn___1gAIw Buttons__btnBase___2Z659 Buttons__withIcon___3aIam" disabled="" aria-disabled="true" aria-label="Thumbs up for this answer." tabindex="-1"><svg class="Cur(p)" width="24" style="fill:#6e7780;stroke:#6e7780;stroke-width:0;vertical-align:bottom" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" data-icon="thumb-up"><path d="M23 10.9c0-1.6-1.6-2.6-3.2-2.6h-4.5c.4-1.1.5-2.5.3-4.1-.2-1.7-1.3-2.9-2.7-3.1-1.5-.2-2.8.6-2.8 2.1.1 1.3-.4 2.2-1.5 3.5-.1 0-.2.2-.4.3-.5.6-1.2 1.2-1.8 1.7l-.5.5H2.1c-.6 0-1.1.4-1.1 1V22c0 .5.5 1 1.1 1h4.2c.6 0 1.1-.4 1.1-1h10.8c1.4 0 2.7-.9 2.7-2.5 0-.4-.1-.8-.2-1.1.6-.4 1-1 1-1.7 0-.4-.1-.8-.3-1.1.6-.4 1-1 1-1.8 0-.4-.1-.8-.2-1.1.4-.5.8-1.1.8-1.8zm-2.7 2.6zM5.2 21H3.1v-9.9h2.1V21zm13-1H7.4v-9.4c.2-.1.3-.3.5-.4.6-.6 1.3-1.2 1.9-1.9.2-.1.3-.3.5-.5 1.4-1.6 2-3 2-4.8 0 0 0-.1.3 0 .5.1.9.5 1 1.4.3 2.1-.2 3.7-.6 4.1-.8.6-.3 1.7.7 1.7h6.2c.6 0 1.1.4 1.1.7s-.5.7-.6.7c-1.4 0-1.4 1.8-.1 2 0 .1.1.2.1.3s0 .2-.2.2c-.2.1-.4.1-.6.1-1.2 0-1.5 1.5-.4 1.9l.2.2c.2.1.2.3.2.5 0 .1-.1.1-.3.2-.2.1-.4.2-.6.2-1.1.1-1.2 1.6-.1 1.9l.1.1s.2.2.2.4c-.2.3-.4.4-.7.4z"></path></svg><span>1</span></button><button class="Buttons__linkBtn___1gAIw Buttons__btnBase___2Z659 Buttons__withIcon___3aIam" disabled="" aria-disabled="true" aria-label="Thumbs down for this answer." tabindex="-1"><svg class="Cur(p)" width="24" style="fill:#6e7780;stroke:#6e7780;stroke-width:0;vertical-align:bottom" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" data-icon="thumb-down"><path d="M1 13.1c0 1.6 1.6 2.6 3.2 2.6h4.5c-.4 1.1-.5 2.5-.3 4.1.2 1.7 1.3 2.9 2.7 3.1 1.5.2 2.8-.6 2.8-2.1-.1-1.3.4-2.2 1.5-3.5.1-.2.3-.3.4-.5.6-.6 1.2-1.2 1.8-1.7.2-.2.4-.3.6-.5H22c.6 0 1.1-.4 1.1-1V2c0-.5-.5-1-1.1-1h-4.2c-.6 0-1.1.4-1.1 1H5.9c-1.4 0-2.7.9-2.7 2.5 0 .4.1.8.2 1.1-.6.4-1 1-1 1.7 0 .4.1.8.3 1.1-.6.4-1 1-1 1.8 0 .4.1.8.2 1.1-.5.5-.9 1.1-.9 1.8zm2.7-2.6zM18.8 3h2.1v9.9h-2.1V3zm-13 1H16.6v9.4c-.2.1-.3.3-.5.4-.7.6-1.3 1.2-1.9 1.8l-.5.5c-1.4 1.6-2 3-2 4.8 0 0 0 .1-.3 0-.5-.1-.9-.5-1-1.4-.3-2.1.2-3.7.6-4.1.8-.6.3-1.7-.7-1.7H4.2c-.6 0-1.1-.4-1.1-.7s.5-.7.6-.7c1.4 0 1.4-1.8.1-2 0-.1-.1-.2-.1-.3s0-.2.2-.2c.2-.1.4-.1.6-.1 1.2.2 1.6-1.3.5-1.7l-.2-.2c-.2-.1-.3-.3-.3-.5 0-.1.1-.1.3-.2.2-.1.5-.2.6-.2 1.1-.1 1.2-1.6.1-1.9l-.1-.1s-.1-.2-.1-.4c0-.4.2-.5.5-.5z"></path></svg><span>1</span></button></div><div class="AnswerActionBar__right___nWVBY"><button class="Buttons__linkBtn___1gAIw Buttons__btnBase___2Z659 Buttons__withIcon___3aIam" disabled="" aria-disabled="true" aria-label="Report abuse." tabindex="-1"><svg class="Cur(p)" width="24" style="fill:#6e7780;stroke:#6e7780;stroke-width:0;vertical-align:bottom" height="24" viewBox="0 0 48 48" data-icon="flag"><path d="M40 10H28.62l-2.888-5-.008.004C25.38 4.407 24.74 4 24 4H8c-1.105 0-2 .896-2 2v36c0 1.105.895 2 2 2s2-.895 2-2V28h12.846l2.887 5c.357.62 1.018 1 1.732 1H40c1.105 0 2-.895 2-2V12c0-1.104-.895-2-2-2zm-2 20h-9.38l-2.888-5c-.357-.617-1.018-1-1.732-1H10V8h12.845l2.887 5c.37.642 1.04 1 1.732 1H38v16z"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></li><li><div class="Answer__answer___FdhNY"><div class="Answer__answerer___ZcKj-"><div class="UserProfile__container___1AkWy"><div class="UserProfile__profileWrapper___2XpWd" style="cursor:pointer"><div class="UserProfile__avatar___2gI-3"><a href="/activity/questions?show=a04d8ba01741e52edd70eed372868226aa" aria-label="Visit Mr. Bad Day&#x27;s profile page."><img src="https://s.yimg.com/ag/images/4684/24185590917_1ff202_128sq.jpg" alt="Mr. Bad Day&#x27;s avatar" aria-hidden="true"/></a></div><div class="UserProfile__userInfo___PiPKv"><a class="UserProfile__userName___1d1RW" href="/activity/questions?show=a04d8ba01741e52edd70eed372868226aa">Mr. Bad Day</a><div class="LevelBadge__levelBadge___2GjGv"><span>Lv <!-- -->7</span></div></div></div><div class="UserProfile__childrenWrapper___2A5yC"><div class="Answer__subtitle___23J6D">1 decade ago</div></div></div></div><div class="ExpandableContent__content___2Iw4v" style="max-height:120px"><p>There are several religions that proseltize to others.

Make the chrisitians and the jews convert and pay a tax\&quot;. (rough paraphrase sorry).\r\n\r\nSome people say that&#x27;s because of defense, but honestly.  That completely contradicts the previous statement. But it&#x27;s all within the same Surah.\r\n\r\nI think this \&quot;no compulsion in religion\&quot; thing is nothing more than a Trojan Horse.\r\n\r\nThe crusades were a big part of why the west isn&#x27;t muslim.\r\n\r\nLook at places like Armenian where some 2 million christians were slaughtered.&quot;,&quot;attachedImageUrl&quot;:null,&quot;attachedImageId&quot;:null,&quot;reference&quot;:null,&quot;isBestAnswer&quot;:true,&quot;thumbsDown&quot;:3,&quot;thumbsUp&quot;:2,&quot;isAnonymous&quot;:true,&quot;commentCount&quot;:0,&quot;createdTime&quot;:&quot;2006-12-17T05:48:42Z&quot;,&quot;userAnswerRelation&quot;:{&quot;hasFlagged&quot;:false,&quot;canFlag&quot;:true,&quot;canVote&quot;:false,&quot;canChooseBestAnswer&quot;:false,&quot;hasVoted&quot;:false,&quot;isAuthor&quot;:false,&quot;hasCommented&quot;:false,&quot;canComment&quot;:true},&quot;bestAnswerAwardTimestamp&quot;:1166352510000,&quot;bestAnswerRating&quot;:3},&quot;isLocked&quot;:true,&quot;saveCount&quot;:0,&quot;isAnonymous&quot;:false,&quot;canChooseBestAnswer&quot;:false,&quot;userQuestionRelation&quot;:{&quot;canAnswer&quot;:true,&quot;hasAnswered&quot;:false,&quot;hasFlagged&quot;:false,&quot;hasStarred&quot;:false,&quot;isAuthor&quot;:false},&quot;saveBtnError&quot;:null,&quot;anonymousBtnError&quot;:null,&quot;updateError&quot;:null,&quot;deleteError&quot;:null,&quot;postAnswerError&quot;:null,&quot;reportAbuseError&quot;:null,&quot;setCategoryError&quot;:null,&quot;postQuestionError&quot;:null,&quot;isUpdating&quot;:false,&quot;isUpdateDone&quot;:false,&quot;isChoosingBestAnswer&quot;:false,&quot;isDeleting&quot;:false,&quot;isDeleteDone&quot;:false,&quot;isPostingAnswer&quot;:false,&quot;isPostAnswerDone&quot;:false,&quot;isSettingCategory&quot;:false,&quot;isSetCategoryDone&quot;:false,&quot;isPostingQuestion&quot;:false,&quot;isPostQuestionDone&quot;:false,&quot;categoryAssocSpaceId&quot;:2115300573,&quot;answerCount&quot;:20},&quot;extraQuestions&quot;:{&quot;keys&quot;:[],&quot;byKey&quot;:{}},&quot;questionAnswersList&quot;:{&quot;20061217053357AAWeGOj&quot;:{&quot;qid&quot;:&quot;20061217053357AAWeGOj&quot;,&quot;count&quot;:10,&quot;answerCount&quot;:20,&quot;start&quot;:1,&quot;lang&quot;:&quot;en-US&quot;,&quot;sortType&quot;:&quot;RELEVANCE&quot;,&quot;answers&quot;:[{&quot;qid&quot;:&quot;20061217053357AAWeGOj&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;8QsIWzdPx1qfLsNIFL4u-iv47DgYc5t8GXzPHx1WapZX3coGI4VPnQkuSZYHr7b5mgl9eOGsyQjMHq04ehqLyIw=&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Islam can not be forced on someone.

Not ONCE did ANY of my Muslim friends &#x27;feed&#x27; me with their religion, even after i made it known.

Most are quite nice, respectful people who respect other people&#x27;s choice in religion, including Islamic people!&quot;,&quot;attachedImageUrl&quot;:null,&quot;attachedImageId&quot;:null,&quot;reference&quot;:null,&quot;answerer&quot;:{&quot;euid&quot;:&quot;wXLA4el_j1pLvEjvW8qO2OXezg5D7sEtpEe4Pso9eA--&quot;,&quot;kid&quot;:&quot;c347c309d9abac51eadd19399636ce7baa&quot;,&quot;nickname&quot;:&quot;Enceladus&quot;,&quot;imageUrl&quot;:&quot;https://s.yimg.com/dh/ap/social/profile/profile_b48.png&quot;,&quot;level&quot;:5},&quot;isBestAnswer&quot;:false,&quot;thumbsDown&quot;:2,&quot;thumbsUp&quot;:2,&quot;isAnonymous&quot;:false,&quot;commentCount&quot;:0,&quot;createdTime&quot;:&quot;2006-12-17T13:36:44Z&quot;,&quot;userAnswerRelation&quot;:{&quot;hasFlagged&quot;:false,&quot;canFlag&quot;:true,&quot;canVote&quot;:false,&quot;canChooseBestAnswer&quot;:false,&quot;hasVoted&quot;:false,&quot;isAuthor&quot;:false,&quot;hasCommented&quot;:false,&quot;canComment&quot;:true}},{&quot;qid&quot;:&quot;20061217053357AAWeGOj&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;uECUwyVPx1qnAHctzPCPgxPWCnltZFWxl44QIk014XLbJfNEJYdWEP9sy1Rzg7JjKj5EcJtUblq54NVr_M7U9D4=&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;I&#x27;m sure, u haven&#x27;t read about this religion well\r\nactually it doesn&#x27;t force anyone to be a muslim. if it is, why there is still non muslims all over the world?\r\nif u know the holy Quraan (the holy book sent from God to his prophet Muhammed) says no forcing in religion , the good and bad is obvious \r\nalso the prophet Muhammed treated the non muslims very well in his life and ordered the muslims not to harm any non muslim unless the non muslim started hurting.\r\n\r\n(sorry if i couldn&#x27;t translate what the god exactly says in the book)\r\nplz read more&quot;,&quot;attachedImageUrl&quot;:null,&quot;attachedImageId&quot;:null,&quot;reference&quot;:null,&quot;answerer&quot;:{&quot;euid&quot;:&quot;YkLvShdmjlTGLp5X8BsHbYOBj5WR_2lqdiDRXDUENg--&quot;,&quot;kid&quot;:&quot;f13c889192456b75fd96299b8176ff5baa&quot;,&quot;nickname&quot;:&quot;Diamond&quot;,&quot;imageUrl&quot;:&quot;https://s.yimg.com/ag/images/4494/23726455267_f7e21c_128sq.jpg&quot;,&quot;level&quot;:2},&quot;isBestAnswer&quot;:false,&quot;thumbsDown&quot;:3,&quot;thumbsUp&quot;:0,&quot;isAnonymous&quot;:false,&quot;commentCount&quot;:0,&quot;createdTime&quot;:&quot;2006-12-17T13:49:40Z&quot;,&quot;userAnswerRelation&quot;:{&quot;hasFlagged&quot;:false,&quot;canFlag&quot;:true,&quot;canVote&quot;:false,&quot;canChooseBestAnswer&quot;:false,&quot;hasVoted&quot;:false,&quot;isAuthor&quot;:false,&quot;hasCommented&quot;:false,&quot;canComment&quot;:true}},{&quot;qid&quot;:&quot;20061217053357AAWeGOj&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;0GUSqZJPx1ruzke-_XBPBR7MOM2h9foMg-uRNAakZbOy1EaSdJwHbeU=&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;That was Mohammad&#x27;s dream that the whole world be Muslim.

told you that?\r\n\r\nIslam clearly teaches there shall be no compulsion in religion.\r\n\r\nMy dear, that is exactly the reason why when Islam conquered Spain, there were enough Christians to drive Muslims out.\r\n\r\nAgain, it is exactly the sheltering allitude of Muslims that made Jews to return to middle east during their persecution in Christian west, and now trying to take the homelands from the Arabs.\r\n\r\nIslam is viewed suspiciously and dangerously, why?\r\nBecause it is growing fast, which is hard for anyone of the other religion to digest.\r\n\r\nCheck out this site

All religions force their religion on others. You live in a Christian country, so do I. There are people out there preaching.
