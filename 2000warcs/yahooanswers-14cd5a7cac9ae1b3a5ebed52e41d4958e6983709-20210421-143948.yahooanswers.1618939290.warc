That having been said they can be used safely and the media hypes up how &quot;bad&quot; they are while doctors use them to save lives. But thats not relevant for this answer. The point is steroids dont cause your penis to shrink or make you go outta control with rage. The side effects often differ from person to person and depending on the specific substance you use. The one side effect I can promise you is the suppresion of natural testosterone. At this point in your life your natural test levels are as high as they will ever be which is a good reason to wait. To learn about the other side effects and about proper usage visit steroid.com they have a lot of good truthful info. Don&#39;t listen to all these other ignorant people who don&#39;t have any idea of what steroids are other than what the media tells them if you get down to the actual science side effects can be reduced or eliminated if the proper steps are taken. Also no one has ever died from the use of steroids. None the less, at 16 you can do a lot naturally before you have to think about juicing.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"RoidGuru27"},"dateCreated":"2009-03-14T13:57:30Z","upvoteCount":2},"suggestedAnswer":[{"@type":"Answer","text":"Are Steroids Safe","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"?"},"dateCreated":"2016-10-03T15:44:47Z","upvoteCount":0},{"@type":"Answer","text":"This Site Might Help You.\n\nRE:\nAre steroids safe to take, and are the benefits worth it?

I am contemplating taking steroids, but I want the opinions of others before I make such a drastic change in my life. So far what&#x27;s holding me back is my &quot;package&quot; shrinking and experiencing &quot;roid rage&quot; and flipping on people for no reason. I am also aware that it is bad for your kidneys and you die young, but is there any solid proof of that? or is it just an assumption? Because my aunt&#x27;s ex-boyfriend was loaded on steroids for years and now he&#x27;s in his 50&#x27;s and he&#x27;s fine, all he has is a back problem, and that&#x27;s not from steroids. </p><p></p><p>So, down to the question. What are the 100% CERTAIN negative side effects of steroids? And are they also worth it due to the benefits?</p><p></p><p>I am 16 if that matters, and I have friends at school and they are juicing and they are fine.</p></div></div><div

That having been said they can be used safely and the media hypes up how &quot;bad&quot; they are while doctors use them to save lives. But thats not relevant for this answer. The point is steroids dont cause your penis to shrink or make you go outta control with rage. The side effects often differ from person to person and depending on the specific substance you use. The one side effect I can promise you is the suppresion of natural testosterone. At this point in your life your natural test levels are as high as they will ever be which is a good reason to wait. To learn about the other side effects and about proper usage visit steroid.com they have a lot of good truthful info. Don&#x27;t listen to all these other ignorant people who don&#x27;t have any idea of what steroids are other than what the media tells them if you get down to the actual science side effects can be reduced or eliminated if the proper steps are taken. Also no one has ever died from the use of steroids. None the less, at 16 you can do a lot naturally before you have to think about juicing.</p></div><div class="AnswerActionBar__answerActionBarWrap___bd9es"><div

I am contemplating taking steroids, but I want the opinions of others before I make such a drastic change in my life. So far what&#x27;s holding me back is my \&quot;package\&quot; shrinking and experiencing \&quot;roid rage\&quot; and flipping on people for no reason. I am also aware that it is bad for your kidneys and you die young, but is there any solid proof of that? or is it just an assumption? Because my aunt&#x27;s ex-boyfriend was loaded on steroids for years and now he&#x27;s in his 50&#x27;s and he&#x27;s fine, all he has is a back problem, and that&#x27;s not from steroids. \r\n\r\nSo, down to the question. What are the 100% CERTAIN negative side effects of steroids? And are they also worth it due to the benefits?\r\n\r\nI am 16 if that matters, and I have friends at school and they are juicing and they are fine.&quot;,&quot;updatedDetails&quot;:[],&quot;attachedImageUrl&quot;:null,&quot;bestAnswer&quot;:{&quot;qid&quot;:&quot;20090314122351AAqtpbu&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;QKFDX35Px1oEtc4L1tPoKciNzJSEf3ZfHXFHvBCiaUEV_kgoxPSMC9o=&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;First of all I don&#x27;t condone use for a 16 year-old. That having been said they can be used safely and the media hypes up how \&quot;bad\&quot; they are while doctors use them to save lives. But thats not relevant for this answer. The point is steroids dont cause your penis to shrink or make you go outta control with rage. The side effects often differ from person to person and depending on the specific substance you use. The one side effect I can promise you is the suppresion of natural testosterone. At this point in your life your natural test levels are as high as they will ever be which is a good reason to wait. To learn about the other side effects and about proper usage visit steroid.com they have a lot of good truthful info. Don&#x27;t listen to all these other ignorant people who don&#x27;t have any idea of what steroids are other than what the media tells them if you get down to the actual science side effects can be reduced or eliminated if the proper steps are taken. Also no one has ever died from the use of steroids. None the less, at 16 you can do a lot naturally before you have to think about juicing.&quot;,&quot;attachedImageUrl&quot;:null,&quot;attachedImageId&quot;:null,&quot;reference&quot;:null,&quot;answerer&quot;:{&quot;euid&quot;:&quot;3h1da49k_13YKgIg.JtcxlmqvA.jNxDk8tUY2guC.A--&quot;,&quot;kid&quot;:&quot;EsQDmxphaa&quot;,&quot;nickname&quot;:&quot;RoidGuru27&quot;,&quot;imageUrl&quot;:&quot;https://s.yimg.com/ag/images/4561/26525623349_a83a6e_128sq.jpg&quot;,&quot;level&quot;:2},&quot;isBestAnswer&quot;:true,&quot;thumbsDown&quot;:1,&quot;thumbsUp&quot;:2,&quot;isAnonymous&quot;:false,&quot;commentCount&quot;:0,&quot;createdTime&quot;:&quot;2009-03-14T13:57:30Z&quot;,&quot;userAnswerRelation&quot;:{&quot;hasFlagged&quot;:false,&quot;canFlag&quot;:true,&quot;canVote&quot;:false,&quot;canChooseBestAnswer&quot;:false,&quot;hasVoted&quot;:false,&quot;isAuthor&quot;:false,&quot;hasCommented&quot;:false,&quot;canComment&quot;:true},&quot;bestAnswerAwardTimestamp&quot;:1237065357000,&quot;bestAnswerRating&quot;:5},&quot;isLocked&quot;:true,&quot;saveCount&quot;:0,&quot;isAnonymous&quot;:true,&quot;canChooseBestAnswer&quot;:false,&quot;userQuestionRelation&quot;:{&quot;canAnswer&quot;:true,&quot;hasAnswered&quot;:false,&quot;hasFlagged&quot;:false,&quot;hasStarred&quot;:false,&quot;isAuthor&quot;:false},&quot;saveBtnError&quot;:null,&quot;anonymousBtnError&quot;:null,&quot;updateError&quot;:null,&quot;deleteError&quot;:null,&quot;postAnswerError&quot;:null,&quot;reportAbuseError&quot;:null,&quot;setCategoryError&quot;:null,&quot;postQuestionError&quot;:null,&quot;isUpdating&quot;:false,&quot;isUpdateDone&quot;:false,&quot;isChoosingBestAnswer&quot;:false,&quot;isDeleting&quot;:false,&quot;isDeleteDone&quot;:false,&quot;isPostingAnswer&quot;:false,&quot;isPostAnswerDone&quot;:false,&quot;isSettingCategory&quot;:false,&quot;isSetCategoryDone&quot;:false,&quot;isPostingQuestion&quot;:false,&quot;isPostQuestionDone&quot;:false,&quot;categoryAssocSpaceId&quot;:2114700780,&quot;answerCount&quot;:9},&quot;extraQuestions&quot;:{&quot;keys&quot;:[],&quot;byKey&quot;:{}},&quot;questionAnswersList&quot;:{&quot;20090314122351AAqtpbu&quot;:{&quot;qid&quot;:&quot;20090314122351AAqtpbu&quot;,&quot;count&quot;:10,&quot;answerCount&quot;:10,&quot;start&quot;:1,&quot;lang&quot;:&quot;en-US&quot;,&quot;sortType&quot;:&quot;RELEVANCE&quot;,&quot;answers&quot;:[{&quot;qid&quot;:&quot;20090314122351AAqtpbu&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;ESg_ux5Px1qE8F8krWSy_3Y6jGQCgEUDraUlc5ASwo10FYSsp-KE3zA=&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Are Steroids Safe&quot;,&quot;attachedImageUrl&quot;:null,&quot;attachedImageId&quot;:null,&quot;reference&quot;:&quot;https://shrink.im/a0SQn&quot;,&quot;answerer&quot;:{&quot;euid&quot;:&quot;GKxnAoRz_l8icR.DSwGHIhQy1OVPyq3oCXwIJdqm2A--&quot;,&quot;kid&quot;:&quot;KoQkyxgFaa&quot;,&quot;nickname&quot;:&quot;?&quot;,&quot;imageUrl&quot;:&quot;https://s.yimg.com/dh/ap/social/profile/profile_b48.png&quot;,&quot;level&quot;:4},&quot;isBestAnswer&quot;:false,&quot;thumbsDown&quot;:0,&quot;thumbsUp&quot;:0,&quot;isAnonymous&quot;:false,&quot;commentCount&quot;:0,&quot;createdTime&quot;:&quot;2016-10-03T15:44:47Z&quot;,&quot;userAnswerRelation&quot;:{&quot;hasFlagged&quot;:false,&quot;canFlag&quot;:true,&quot;canVote&quot;:false,&quot;canChooseBestAnswer&quot;:false,&quot;hasVoted&quot;:false,&quot;isAuthor&quot;:false,&quot;hasCommented&quot;:false,&quot;canComment&quot;:true}},{&quot;qid&quot;:&quot;20090314122351AAqtpbu&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;pXaxSGxPx1rdU3er0RLHJApwdth3htJQpEai6bG-zR8HUMbEQTyqhwo=&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;This Site Might Help You.\n\nRE:\nAre steroids safe to take, and are the benefits worth it?
