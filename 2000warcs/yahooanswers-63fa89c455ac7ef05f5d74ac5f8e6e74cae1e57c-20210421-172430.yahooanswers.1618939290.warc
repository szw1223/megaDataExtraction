my grandparents were driving me to work on their way to the YMCA. We came to a stop in the middle of the highway when there was only minimal, early-morning traffic. It was adorable - this little family of ducks were crossing the road. Everyone with a functioning brain and a decent set of morals stopped to let them pass. It was so cute because the mom was hurrying her little ducklings along as if she knew she was holding up a big line. But this very stupid couple was driving down the highway, and they had at least 15 metres to see the ducks. No, they didn&#x27;t hit them, but only because the ducks got across the street fast enough. Well this guy and his (I&#x27;m assuming) girlfriend cut the couple off and forced them to the side of the road. The guy got out of his car and proceeded to really rail on them. I swear, their faces were white by the time he was done with them. I commend him. What do you think of the couple? What do you think of the guy&#x27;s reaction?

Not only is it incredibly dangerous and highly illegal, but it can easily incite road rage and then many more people could be hurt.  While it was a nice thought for the guy to tear the rude couple a new one, it was foolish and dangerous.
