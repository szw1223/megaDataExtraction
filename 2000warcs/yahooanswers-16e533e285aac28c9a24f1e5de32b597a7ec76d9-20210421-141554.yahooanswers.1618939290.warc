There is nothing in what you&#39;ve said indicating he is cheating.  \r\n\r\nThe idea that all men are raging sex machines is a myth.  The libido, or desire for sex, is a lot like the color of our eyes - our height, etc., that stuff was set the instant we were conceived, and there isn&#39;t a hell of a lot we can do about it whether our sex drive is high, low or any shade in between.\r\n\r\nGuys generally hit the peak of their sex drive between the ages of 19 and 25; for you ladies it&#39;s 28 to 35.  Even guys with a low libido can loose most of their interest by the time they are 35, and couldn&#39;t care less by 40 - of course, it&#39;s a gradual thing, and I&#39;ve known of guys who lost it earlier than that.  \r\n\r\nWhat you&#39;ve described sounds like a guy with a rather low libido, but since you initially got together when he was near his peak neither of you realized it.  One of the co-lateral problems is most guys feel like their sex drive is tied directly to their manhood - so a guy with a low libido starts making all kinds of excuses and often will loose their temper - they know they don&#39;t have the desire like they had at one time and it threatens the hell out of them.  And pills won&#39;t help - pills help a guy with the desire who just can&#39;t get a erection - they don&#39;t do anything for the guy with little or no desire. Another way to look at it is - what the hell has happened to his libido?  And the answer to that is - the same thing that happened to the hair of that guy who had a full head of hair in his high school graduation picture and is bald by the time he&#39;s 25 - it&#39;s gone.\r\n\r\nWhat&#39;s worse is about the time this shows up, his lady is approaching her peak.  She doesn&#39;t know what&#39;s going on either - it must be her.  She starts trying a zillion different things hoping to get him cranked up and nothing works.  Sadly her options are very few and none of them worth a damn: find a lover; use adult toys; learn to live with it; or, leave him.\r\n\r\nMy heart really does go out to you, and I know this hasn&#39;t resolved your problem.  But maybe it helps a little bit to know what is going on.  If you doubt the above - check with your doctor.  Good luck.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"?"},"dateCreated":"2012-04-09T04:58:54Z","upvoteCount":0},"suggestedAnswer":[{"@type":"Answer","text":"it rather is so which you ought to the factor Ive additionally heard adult males will do all maximum something for intercourse and ladies will do very nearly something for money &amp; love women do no longer go with intercourse they do basically it reason they know that&#39;s what the guy needs a guy might nicely be a great lover yet enable him be broke and lazy shes long previous. if he wasn&#39;t the main suitable lover yet he buys her diamonds buys a house and has a reliable activity she will wash his grimy attracts and nonetheless will do him basically to maintain that money coming in I mite get an excellent form of thumbs down from women yet it rather is a fact","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"haughney"},"dateCreated":"2016-11-12T11:32:53Z","upvoteCount":0},{"@type":"Answer","text":"&quot;...been together&quot; is your answer...  \r\n\r\nThe thrill is gone, babe...","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"virgod"},"dateCreated":"2012-04-09T05:00:19Z","upvoteCount":0},{"@type":"Answer","text":"Too much porn.

There is nothing in what you&#x27;ve said indicating he is cheating.  </p><p></p><p>The idea that all men are raging sex machines is a myth.  The libido, or desire for sex, is a lot like the color of our eyes - our height, etc., that stuff was set the instant we were conceived, and there isn&#x27;t a hell of a lot we can do about it whether our sex drive is high, low or any shade in between.</p><p></p><p>Guys generally hit the peak of their sex drive between the ages of 19 and 25; for you ladies it&#x27;s 28 to 35.  Even guys with a low libido can loose most of their interest by the time they are 35, and couldn&#x27;t care less by 40 - of course, it&#x27;s a gradual thing, and I&#x27;ve known of guys who lost it earlier than that.  </p><p></p><p>What you&#x27;ve described sounds like a guy with a rather low libido, but since you initially got together when he was near his peak neither of you realized it.  One of the co-lateral problems is most guys feel like their sex drive is tied directly to their manhood - so a guy with a low libido starts making all kinds of excuses and often will loose their temper - they know they don&#x27;t have the desire like they had at one time and it threatens the hell out of them.  And pills won&#x27;t help - pills help a guy with the desire who just can&#x27;t get a erection - they don&#x27;t do anything for the guy with little or no desire. Another way to look at it is - what the hell has happened to his libido?  And the answer to that is - the same thing that happened to the hair of that guy who had a full head of hair in his high school graduation picture and is bald by the time he&#x27;s 25 - it&#x27;s gone.</p><p></p><p>What&#x27;s worse is about the time this shows up, his lady is approaching her peak.  She doesn&#x27;t know what&#x27;s going on either - it must be her.  She starts trying a zillion different things hoping to get him cranked up and nothing works.  Sadly her options are very few and none of them worth a damn: find a lover; use adult toys; learn to live with it; or, leave him.</p><p></p><p>My heart really does go out to you, and I know this hasn&#x27;t resolved your problem.  But maybe it helps a little bit to know what is going on.  If you doubt the above - check with your doctor.  Good luck.</p></div><div class="AnswerActionBar__answerActionBarWrap___bd9es"><div class="AnswerActionBar__answerActionBar___1LrM2"><div class="AnswerActionBar__left___5SkAf"><button class="Buttons__linkBtn___1gAIw Buttons__btnBase___2Z659 Buttons__withIcon___3aIam" disabled="" aria-disabled="true" aria-label="Thumbs up for this answer." tabindex="-1"><svg class="Cur(p)" width="24" style="fill:#6e7780;stroke:#6e7780;stroke-width:0;vertical-align:bottom" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" data-icon="thumb-up"><path d="M23 10.9c0-1.6-1.6-2.6-3.2-2.6h-4.5c.4-1.1.5-2.5.3-4.1-.2-1.7-1.3-2.9-2.7-3.1-1.5-.2-2.8.6-2.8 2.1.1 1.3-.4 2.2-1.5 3.5-.1 0-.2.2-.4.3-.5.6-1.2 1.2-1.8 1.7l-.5.5H2.1c-.6 0-1.1.4-1.1 1V22c0 .5.5 1 1.1 1h4.2c.6 0 1.1-.4 1.1-1h10.8c1.4 0 2.7-.9 2.7-2.5 0-.4-.1-.8-.2-1.1.6-.4 1-1 1-1.7 0-.4-.1-.8-.3-1.1.6-.4 1-1 1-1.8 0-.4-.1-.8-.2-1.1.4-.5.8-1.1.8-1.8zm-2.7 2.6zM5.2 21H3.1v-9.9h2.1V21zm13-1H7.4v-9.4c.2-.1.3-.3.5-.4.6-.6 1.3-1.2 1.9-1.9.2-.1.3-.3.5-.5 1.4-1.6 2-3 2-4.8 0 0 0-.1.3 0 .5.1.9.5 1 1.4.3 2.1-.2 3.7-.6 4.1-.8.6-.3 1.7.7 1.7h6.2c.6 0 1.1.4 1.1.7s-.5.7-.6.7c-1.4 0-1.4 1.8-.1 2 0 .1.1.2.1.3s0 .2-.2.2c-.2.1-.4.1-.6.1-1.2 0-1.5 1.5-.4 1.9l.2.2c.2.1.2.3.2.5 0 .1-.1.1-.3.2-.2.1-.4.2-.6.2-1.1.1-1.2 1.6-.1 1.9l.1.1s.2.2.2.4c-.2.3-.4.4-.7.4z"></path></svg><span>0</span></button><button class="Buttons__linkBtn___1gAIw Buttons__btnBase___2Z659 Buttons__withIcon___3aIam" disabled="" aria-disabled="true" aria-label="Thumbs down for this answer." tabindex="-1"><svg class="Cur(p)" width="24" style="fill:#6e7780;stroke:#6e7780;stroke-width:0;vertical-align:bottom" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" data-icon="thumb-down"><path d="M1 13.1c0 1.6 1.6 2.6 3.2 2.6h4.5c-.4 1.1-.5 2.5-.3 4.1.2 1.7 1.3 2.9 2.7 3.1 1.5.2 2.8-.6 2.8-2.1-.1-1.3.4-2.2 1.5-3.5.1-.2.3-.3.4-.5.6-.6 1.2-1.2 1.8-1.7.2-.2.4-.3.6-.5H22c.6 0 1.1-.4 1.1-1V2c0-.5-.5-1-1.1-1h-4.2c-.6 0-1.1.4-1.1 1H5.9c-1.4 0-2.7.9-2.7 2.5 0 .4.1.8.2 1.1-.6.4-1 1-1 1.7 0 .4.1.8.3 1.1-.6.4-1 1-1 1.8 0 .4.1.8.2 1.1-.5.5-.9 1.1-.9 1.8zm2.7-2.6zM18.8 3h2.1v9.9h-2.1V3zm-13 1H16.6v9.4c-.2.1-.3.3-.5.4-.7.6-1.3 1.2-1.9 1.8l-.5.5c-1.4 1.6-2 3-2 4.8 0 0 0 .1-.3 0-.5-.1-.9-.5-1-1.4-.3-2.1.2-3.7.6-4.1.8-.6.3-1.7-.7-1.7H4.2c-.6 0-1.1-.4-1.1-.7s.5-.7.6-.7c1.4 0 1.4-1.8.1-2 0-.1-.1-.2-.1-.3s0-.2.2-.2c.2-.1.4-.1.6-.1 1.2.2 1.6-1.3.5-1.7l-.2-.2c-.2-.1-.3-.3-.3-.5 0-.1.1-.1.3-.2.2-.1.5-.2.6-.2 1.1-.1 1.2-1.6.1-1.9l-.1-.1s-.1-.2-.1-.4c0-.4.2-.5.5-.5z"></path></svg><span>1</span></button></div><div class="AnswerActionBar__right___nWVBY"><button class="Buttons__linkBtn___1gAIw Buttons__btnBase___2Z659 Buttons__withIcon___3aIam" disabled="" aria-disabled="true" aria-label="Report abuse." tabindex="-1"><svg class="Cur(p)" width="24" style="fill:#6e7780;stroke:#6e7780;stroke-width:0;vertical-align:bottom" height="24" viewBox="0 0 48 48" data-icon="flag"><path d="M40 10H28.62l-2.888-5-.008.004C25.38 4.407 24.74 4 24 4H8c-1.105 0-2 .896-2 2v36c0 1.105.895 2 2 2s2-.895 2-2V28h12.846l2.887 5c.357.62 1.018 1 1.732 1H40c1.105 0 2-.895 2-2V12c0-1.104-.895-2-2-2zm-2 20h-9.38l-2.888-5c-.357-.617-1.018-1-1.732-1H10V8h12.845l2.887 5c.37.642 1.04 1 1.732 1H38v16z"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></li><li><div class="Answer__answer___FdhNY"><div class="Answer__answerer___ZcKj-"><div class="UserProfile__container___1AkWy"><div class="UserProfile__profileWrapper___2XpWd" style="cursor:pointer"><div class="UserProfile__avatar___2gI-3"><a href="/activity/questions?show=9JT6Ngscaa" aria-label="Visit haughney&#x27;s profile page."><img src="https://s.yimg.com/ag/images/default_user_profile_pic_128sq.jpg" alt="haughney&#x27;s avatar" aria-hidden="true"/></a></div><div class="UserProfile__userInfo___PiPKv"><a class="UserProfile__userName___1d1RW" href="/activity/questions?show=9JT6Ngscaa">haughney</a><div class="LevelBadge__levelBadge___2GjGv"><span>Lv <!-- -->4</span></div></div></div><div class="UserProfile__childrenWrapper___2A5yC"><div class="Answer__subtitle___23J6D">5 years ago</div></div></div></div><div class="ExpandableContent__content___2Iw4v" style="max-height:120px"><p>it rather is so which you ought to the factor Ive additionally heard adult males will do all maximum something for intercourse and ladies will do very nearly something for money &amp;

We rarely have sex now..&quot;,&quot;updatedDetails&quot;:[],&quot;attachedImageUrl&quot;:null,&quot;bestAnswer&quot;:{&quot;qid&quot;:&quot;20120409032507AAYcBrI&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;QcASpI9Px1qiJCU9XnhhZPwx-JO8OqBPiLNBjt_iFFCi4X2t4_8iFa8=&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;I haven&#x27;t read all the responses you&#x27;ve received but I got a look at the first one and she if full of crap.  There is nothing in what you&#x27;ve said indicating he is cheating.  \r\n\r\nThe idea that all men are raging sex machines is a myth.  The libido, or desire for sex, is a lot like the color of our eyes - our height, etc., that stuff was set the instant we were conceived, and there isn&#x27;t a hell of a lot we can do about it whether our sex drive is high, low or any shade in between.\r\n\r\nGuys generally hit the peak of their sex drive between the ages of 19 and 25; for you ladies it&#x27;s 28 to 35.  Even guys with a low libido can loose most of their interest by the time they are 35, and couldn&#x27;t care less by 40 - of course, it&#x27;s a gradual thing, and I&#x27;ve known of guys who lost it earlier than that.  \r\n\r\nWhat you&#x27;ve described sounds like a guy with a rather low libido, but since you initially got together when he was near his peak neither of you realized it.  One of the co-lateral problems is most guys feel like their sex drive is tied directly to their manhood - so a guy with a low libido starts making all kinds of excuses and often will loose their temper - they know they don&#x27;t have the desire like they had at one time and it threatens the hell out of them.  And pills won&#x27;t help - pills help a guy with the desire who just can&#x27;t get a erection - they don&#x27;t do anything for the guy with little or no desire. Another way to look at it is - what the hell has happened to his libido?  And the answer to that is - the same thing that happened to the hair of that guy who had a full head of hair in his high school graduation picture and is bald by the time he&#x27;s 25 - it&#x27;s gone.\r\n\r\nWhat&#x27;s worse is about the time this shows up, his lady is approaching her peak.  She doesn&#x27;t know what&#x27;s going on either - it must be her.  She starts trying a zillion different things hoping to get him cranked up and nothing works.  Sadly her options are very few and none of them worth a damn: find a lover; use adult toys; learn to live with it; or, leave him.\r\n\r\nMy heart really does go out to you, and I know this hasn&#x27;t resolved your problem.  But maybe it helps a little bit to know what is going on.  If you doubt the above - check with your doctor.  Good luck.&quot;,&quot;attachedImageUrl&quot;:null,&quot;attachedImageId&quot;:null,&quot;reference&quot;:null,&quot;answerer&quot;:{&quot;euid&quot;:&quot;1jgjWmd3_ifH4Yfjh4yAqivLZIYLvyA7xMNkPxvlCQ--&quot;,&quot;kid&quot;:&quot;4RHXa58gaa&quot;,&quot;nickname&quot;:&quot;?&quot;,&quot;imageUrl&quot;:&quot;https://s.yimg.com/dh/ap/social/profile/profile_b48.png&quot;,&quot;level&quot;:7},&quot;isBestAnswer&quot;:true,&quot;thumbsDown&quot;:1,&quot;thumbsUp&quot;:0,&quot;isAnonymous&quot;:false,&quot;commentCount&quot;:0,&quot;createdTime&quot;:&quot;2012-04-09T04:58:54Z&quot;,&quot;userAnswerRelation&quot;:{&quot;hasFlagged&quot;:false,&quot;canFlag&quot;:true,&quot;canVote&quot;:false,&quot;canChooseBestAnswer&quot;:false,&quot;hasVoted&quot;:false,&quot;isAuthor&quot;:false,&quot;hasCommented&quot;:false,&quot;canComment&quot;:true},&quot;bestAnswerAwardTimestamp&quot;:1334461409000},&quot;isLocked&quot;:true,&quot;saveCount&quot;:0,&quot;isAnonymous&quot;:false,&quot;canChooseBestAnswer&quot;:false,&quot;userQuestionRelation&quot;:{&quot;canAnswer&quot;:true,&quot;hasAnswered&quot;:false,&quot;hasFlagged&quot;:false,&quot;hasStarred&quot;:false,&quot;isAuthor&quot;:false},&quot;saveBtnError&quot;:null,&quot;anonymousBtnError&quot;:null,&quot;updateError&quot;:null,&quot;deleteError&quot;:null,&quot;postAnswerError&quot;:null,&quot;reportAbuseError&quot;:null,&quot;setCategoryError&quot;:null,&quot;postQuestionError&quot;:null,&quot;isUpdating&quot;:false,&quot;isUpdateDone&quot;:false,&quot;isChoosingBestAnswer&quot;:false,&quot;isDeleting&quot;:false,&quot;isDeleteDone&quot;:false,&quot;isPostingAnswer&quot;:false,&quot;isPostAnswerDone&quot;:false,&quot;isSettingCategory&quot;:false,&quot;isSetCategoryDone&quot;:false,&quot;isPostingQuestion&quot;:false,&quot;isPostQuestionDone&quot;:false,&quot;categoryAssocSpaceId&quot;:2115300545,&quot;answerCount&quot;:16},&quot;extraQuestions&quot;:{&quot;keys&quot;:[],&quot;byKey&quot;:{}},&quot;questionAnswersList&quot;:{&quot;20120409032507AAYcBrI&quot;:{&quot;qid&quot;:&quot;20120409032507AAYcBrI&quot;,&quot;count&quot;:10,&quot;answerCount&quot;:16,&quot;start&quot;:1,&quot;lang&quot;:&quot;en-US&quot;,&quot;sortType&quot;:&quot;RELEVANCE&quot;,&quot;answers&quot;:[{&quot;qid&quot;:&quot;20120409032507AAYcBrI&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;y0AQkIVPx1rtpe3lYcybeMrmJi-Cv9wA660VdyGKx5QK7fO9-eDiGnA=&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;it rather is so which you ought to the factor Ive additionally heard adult males will do all maximum something for intercourse and ladies will do very nearly something for money &amp;
