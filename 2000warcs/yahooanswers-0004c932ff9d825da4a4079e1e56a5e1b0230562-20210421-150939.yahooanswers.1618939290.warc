But being that your mom has only been with this guy for 2 months I would hope that she wouldn&#39;t consider marrying this person, after 2 months you do not know a person well enough to get engaged.  You need to talk to her about this.  Also, my son&#39;s father&#39;s family has this going on in it too.  Not meaning to but all the rest of the family thinks its pretty sick.  And when one couple is having an issue and wants to go to their parent for advice it will more than likely start trouble for the parents too.  So not a good idea.

The news for you is you don&#39;t need to feel bad about liking him, because you liked him BEFORE you knew his dad and your mom were hooking up. Unfortunately, if they get married and you guys live together, things would be WAY too complicated and weird to keep your relationship going. I bet it&#39;s happened more times than people realize, but unless you guys just don&#39;t care, I&#39;d say the wise thing might be to end it... since he will be your stepbrother - unless you live in West Virginia ;) lol jk.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Anonymous"},"dateCreated":"2009-01-25T17:01:51Z","upvoteCount":1},{"@type":"Answer","text":"nicely I would desire to confess, i replaced right into a ought to bit uncomfortable related to the Marcia and Greg element on the Brady Bunch action picture sequal, yet you&#39;re actually not genetically on the subject be counted of him and weren&#39;t raised with him.

You need to talk to her about this.  Also, my son&#x27;s father&#x27;s family has this going on in it too.  Not meaning to but all the rest of the family thinks its pretty sick.

I&#x27;d be worried if I were your mom about the two of you living together doing who knows what when you&#x27;re alone.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps you two can cool it for a while, see where your mom&#x27;s relatioship goes and take it from there.</p></div><div class="AnswerActionBar__answerActionBarWrap___bd9es"><div class="AnswerActionBar__answerActionBar___1LrM2"><div class="AnswerActionBar__left___5SkAf"><button class="Buttons__linkBtn___1gAIw Buttons__btnBase___2Z659 Buttons__withIcon___3aIam" disabled="" aria-disabled="true" aria-label="Thumbs up for this answer." tabindex="-1"><svg class="Cur(p)" width="24" style="fill:#6e7780;stroke:#6e7780;stroke-width:0;vertical-align:bottom" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" data-icon="thumb-up"><path d="M23 10.9c0-1.6-1.6-2.6-3.2-2.6h-4.5c.4-1.1.5-2.5.3-4.1-.2-1.7-1.3-2.9-2.7-3.1-1.5-.2-2.8.6-2.8 2.1.1 1.3-.4 2.2-1.5 3.5-.1 0-.2.2-.4.3-.5.6-1.2 1.2-1.8 1.7l-.5.5H2.1c-.6 0-1.1.4-1.1 1V22c0 .5.5 1 1.1 1h4.2c.6 0 1.1-.4 1.1-1h10.8c1.4 0 2.7-.9 2.7-2.5 0-.4-.1-.8-.2-1.1.6-.4 1-1 1-1.7 0-.4-.1-.8-.3-1.1.6-.4 1-1 1-1.8 0-.4-.1-.8-.2-1.1.4-.5.8-1.1.8-1.8zm-2.7 2.6zM5.2 21H3.1v-9.9h2.1V21zm13-1H7.4v-9.4c.2-.1.3-.3.5-.4.6-.6 1.3-1.2 1.9-1.9.2-.1.3-.3.5-.5 1.4-1.6 2-3 2-4.8 0 0 0-.1.3 0 .5.1.9.5 1 1.4.3 2.1-.2 3.7-.6 4.1-.8.6-.3 1.7.7 1.7h6.2c.6 0 1.1.4 1.1.7s-.5.7-.6.7c-1.4 0-1.4 1.8-.1 2 0 .1.1.2.1.3s0 .2-.2.2c-.2.1-.4.1-.6.1-1.2 0-1.5 1.5-.4 1.9l.2.2c.2.1.2.3.2.5 0 .1-.1.1-.3.2-.2.1-.4.2-.6.2-1.1.1-1.2 1.6-.1 1.9l.1.1s.2.2.2.4c-.2.3-.4.4-.7.4z"></path></svg><span>1</span></button><button class="Buttons__linkBtn___1gAIw Buttons__btnBase___2Z659 Buttons__withIcon___3aIam" disabled="" aria-disabled="true" aria-label="Thumbs down for this answer." tabindex="-1"><svg class="Cur(p)" width="24" style="fill:#6e7780;stroke:#6e7780;stroke-width:0;vertical-align:bottom" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" data-icon="thumb-down"><path d="M1 13.1c0 1.6 1.6 2.6 3.2 2.6h4.5c-.4 1.1-.5 2.5-.3 4.1.2 1.7 1.3 2.9 2.7 3.1 1.5.2 2.8-.6 2.8-2.1-.1-1.3.4-2.2 1.5-3.5.1-.2.3-.3.4-.5.6-.6 1.2-1.2 1.8-1.7.2-.2.4-.3.6-.5H22c.6 0 1.1-.4 1.1-1V2c0-.5-.5-1-1.1-1h-4.2c-.6 0-1.1.4-1.1 1H5.9c-1.4 0-2.7.9-2.7 2.5 0 .4.1.8.2 1.1-.6.4-1 1-1 1.7 0 .4.1.8.3 1.1-.6.4-1 1-1 1.8 0 .4.1.8.2 1.1-.5.5-.9 1.1-.9 1.8zm2.7-2.6zM18.8 3h2.1v9.9h-2.1V3zm-13 1H16.6v9.4c-.2.1-.3.3-.5.4-.7.6-1.3 1.2-1.9 1.8l-.5.5c-1.4 1.6-2 3-2 4.8 0 0 0 .1-.3 0-.5-.1-.9-.5-1-1.4-.3-2.1.2-3.7.6-4.1.8-.6.3-1.7-.7-1.7H4.2c-.6 0-1.1-.4-1.1-.7s.5-.7.6-.7c1.4 0 1.4-1.8.1-2 0-.1-.1-.2-.1-.3s0-.2.2-.2c.2-.1.4-.1.6-.1 1.2.2 1.6-1.3.5-1.7l-.2-.2c-.2-.1-.3-.3-.3-.5 0-.1.1-.1.3-.2.2-.1.5-.2.6-.2 1.1-.1 1.2-1.6.1-1.9l-.1-.1s-.1-.2-.1-.4c0-.4.2-.5.5-.5z"></path></svg><span>0</span></button></div><div class="AnswerActionBar__right___nWVBY"><button class="Buttons__linkBtn___1gAIw Buttons__btnBase___2Z659 Buttons__withIcon___3aIam" disabled="" aria-disabled="true" aria-label="Report abuse." tabindex="-1"><svg class="Cur(p)" width="24" style="fill:#6e7780;stroke:#6e7780;stroke-width:0;vertical-align:bottom" height="24" viewBox="0 0 48 48" data-icon="flag"><path d="M40 10H28.62l-2.888-5-.008.004C25.38 4.407 24.74 4 24 4H8c-1.105 0-2 .896-2 2v36c0 1.105.895 2 2 2s2-.895 2-2V28h12.846l2.887 5c.357.62 1.018 1 1.732 1H40c1.105 0 2-.895 2-2V12c0-1.104-.895-2-2-2zm-2 20h-9.38l-2.888-5c-.357-.617-1.018-1-1.732-1H10V8h12.845l2.887 5c.37.642 1.04 1 1.732 1H38v16z"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></li><li><div class="Answer__answer___FdhNY"><div class="Answer__answerer___ZcKj-"><div class="UserProfile__container___1AkWy"><div class="UserProfile__profileWrapper___2XpWd"><div class="UserProfile__avatar___2gI-3"><span class="UserProfile__anonymousAvatarImg___3r5DJ"></span></div><div class="UserProfile__userInfo___PiPKv"><div class="UserProfile__userName___1d1RW">Anonymous</div></div></div><div class="UserProfile__childrenWrapper___2A5yC"><div class="Answer__subtitle___23J6D">1 decade ago</div></div></div></div><div class="ExpandableContent__content___2Iw4v" style="max-height:120px"><p>You are in a bit of a pickle. The news for you is you don&#x27;t need to feel bad about liking him, because you liked him BEFORE you knew his dad and your mom were hooking up. Unfortunately, if they get married and you guys live together, things would be WAY too complicated and weird to keep your relationship going. I bet it&#x27;s happened more times than people realize, but unless you guys just don&#x27;t care, I&#x27;d say the wise thing might be to end it... since he will be your stepbrother - unless you live in West Virginia ;) lol jk.</p></div><div class="AnswerActionBar__answerActionBarWrap___bd9es"><div class="AnswerActionBar__answerActionBar___1LrM2"><div class="AnswerActionBar__left___5SkAf"><button class="Buttons__linkBtn___1gAIw Buttons__btnBase___2Z659 Buttons__withIcon___3aIam" disabled="" aria-disabled="true" aria-label="Thumbs up for this answer." tabindex="-1"><svg class="Cur(p)" width="24" style="fill:#6e7780;stroke:#6e7780;stroke-width:0;vertical-align:bottom" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" data-icon="thumb-up"><path d="M23 10.9c0-1.6-1.6-2.6-3.2-2.6h-4.5c.4-1.1.5-2.5.3-4.1-.2-1.7-1.3-2.9-2.7-3.1-1.5-.2-2.8.6-2.8 2.1.1 1.3-.4 2.2-1.5 3.5-.1 0-.2.2-.4.3-.5.6-1.2 1.2-1.8 1.7l-.5.5H2.1c-.6 0-1.1.4-1.1 1V22c0 .5.5 1 1.1 1h4.2c.6 0 1.1-.4 1.1-1h10.8c1.4 0 2.7-.9 2.7-2.5 0-.4-.1-.8-.2-1.1.6-.4 1-1 1-1.7 0-.4-.1-.8-.3-1.1.6-.4 1-1 1-1.8 0-.4-.1-.8-.2-1.1.4-.5.8-1.1.8-1.8zm-2.7 2.6zM5.2 21H3.1v-9.9h2.1V21zm13-1H7.4v-9.4c.2-.1.3-.3.5-.4.6-.6 1.3-1.2 1.9-1.9.2-.1.3-.3.5-.5 1.4-1.6 2-3 2-4.8 0 0 0-.1.3 0 .5.1.9.5 1 1.4.3 2.1-.2 3.7-.6 4.1-.8.6-.3 1.7.7 1.7h6.2c.6 0 1.1.4 1.1.7s-.5.7-.6.7c-1.4 0-1.4 1.8-.1 2 0 .1.1.2.1.3s0 .2-.2.2c-.2.1-.4.1-.6.1-1.2 0-1.5 1.5-.4 1.9l.2.2c.2.1.2.3.2.5 0 .1-.1.1-.3.2-.2.1-.4.2-.6.2-1.1.1-1.2 1.6-.1 1.9l.1.1s.2.2.2.4c-.2.3-.4.4-.7.4z"></path></svg><span>1</span></button><button class="Buttons__linkBtn___1gAIw Buttons__btnBase___2Z659 Buttons__withIcon___3aIam" disabled="" aria-disabled="true" aria-label="Thumbs down for this answer." tabindex="-1"><svg class="Cur(p)" width="24" style="fill:#6e7780;stroke:#6e7780;stroke-width:0;vertical-align:bottom" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" data-icon="thumb-down"><path d="M1 13.1c0 1.6 1.6 2.6 3.2 2.6h4.5c-.4 1.1-.5 2.5-.3 4.1.2 1.7 1.3 2.9 2.7 3.1 1.5.2 2.8-.6 2.8-2.1-.1-1.3.4-2.2 1.5-3.5.1-.2.3-.3.4-.5.6-.6 1.2-1.2 1.8-1.7.2-.2.4-.3.6-.5H22c.6 0 1.1-.4 1.1-1V2c0-.5-.5-1-1.1-1h-4.2c-.6 0-1.1.4-1.1 1H5.9c-1.4 0-2.7.9-2.7 2.5 0 .4.1.8.2 1.1-.6.4-1 1-1 1.7 0 .4.1.8.3 1.1-.6.4-1 1-1 1.8 0 .4.1.8.2 1.1-.5.5-.9 1.1-.9 1.8zm2.7-2.6zM18.8 3h2.1v9.9h-2.1V3zm-13 1H16.6v9.4c-.2.1-.3.3-.5.4-.7.6-1.3 1.2-1.9 1.8l-.5.5c-1.4 1.6-2 3-2 4.8 0 0 0 .1-.3 0-.5-.1-.9-.5-1-1.4-.3-2.1.2-3.7.6-4.1.8-.6.3-1.7-.7-1.7H4.2c-.6 0-1.1-.4-1.1-.7s.5-.7.6-.7c1.4 0 1.4-1.8.1-2 0-.1-.1-.2-.1-.3s0-.2.2-.2c.2-.1.4-.1.6-.1 1.2.2 1.6-1.3.5-1.7l-.2-.2c-.2-.1-.3-.3-.3-.5 0-.1.1-.1.3-.2.2-.1.5-.2.6-.2 1.1-.1 1.2-1.6.1-1.9l-.1-.1s-.1-.2-.1-.4c0-.4.2-.5.5-.5z"></path></svg><span>0</span></button></div><div class="AnswerActionBar__right___nWVBY"><button class="Buttons__linkBtn___1gAIw Buttons__btnBase___2Z659 Buttons__withIcon___3aIam" disabled="" aria-disabled="true" aria-label="Report abuse." tabindex="-1"><svg class="Cur(p)" width="24" style="fill:#6e7780;stroke:#6e7780;stroke-width:0;vertical-align:bottom" height="24" viewBox="0 0 48 48" data-icon="flag"><path d="M40 10H28.62l-2.888-5-.008.004C25.38 4.407 24.74 4 24 4H8c-1.105 0-2 .896-2 2v36c0 1.105.895 2 2 2s2-.895 2-2V28h12.846l2.887 5c.357.62 1.018 1 1.732 1H40c1.105 0 2-.895 2-2V12c0-1.104-.895-2-2-2zm-2 20h-9.38l-2.888-5c-.357-.617-1.018-1-1.732-1H10V8h12.845l2.887 5c.37.642 1.04 1 1.732 1H38v16z"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></li><li><div class="Answer__answer___FdhNY"><div class="Answer__answerer___ZcKj-"><div class="UserProfile__container___1AkWy"><div class="UserProfile__profileWrapper___2XpWd" style="cursor:pointer"><div class="UserProfile__avatar___2gI-3"><a href="/activity/questions?show=qSyBEpBhaa" aria-label="Visit keyt&#x27;s profile page."><img src="https://s.yimg.com/ag/images/default_user_profile_pic_128sq.jpg" alt="keyt&#x27;s avatar" aria-hidden="true"/></a></div><div class="UserProfile__userInfo___PiPKv"><a class="UserProfile__userName___1d1RW" href="/activity/questions?show=qSyBEpBhaa">keyt</a><div class="LevelBadge__levelBadge___2GjGv"><span>Lv <!-- -->4</span></div></div></div><div class="UserProfile__childrenWrapper___2A5yC"><div class="Answer__subtitle___23J6D">5 years ago</div></div></div></div><div class="ExpandableContent__content___2Iw4v" style="max-height:120px"><p>nicely I would desire to confess, i replaced right into a ought to bit uncomfortable related to the Marcia and Greg element on the Brady Bunch action picture sequal, yet you&#x27;re actually not genetically on the subject be counted of him and weren&#x27;t raised with him.

He is now my boyfriend and we kiss all the time and talk on the phone, all that. Well I know my mom has been dating this one guy for like 2 months, I met him. But when my boyfriend came over to hang out, my moms date was picking her up. When he came inside, he saw my boyfriend on the couch and he said: \&quot;Aaron?\&quot; (that isnt his real name, just usin that)  and &#x27;Aaron&#x27; turns around and says: \&quot;dad?\&quot; so it turns out that hes going to propose to my mom soon. What do i do?? i cant be dating my STEPBROTHER!&quot;,&quot;updatedDetails&quot;:[{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;42qKYrxNwVAL-TarPGTlRyWPtHrtareFzGjXMutREJZRUCCDxOP49Wd2Ekxoc_Hq4css&quot;,&quot;createdTime&quot;:&quot;2009-01-25T17:00:21Z&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;And by the way my mom never got to meet my boyfriends dad knowing hes actually aarons dad. because his dad was always busy when my mom wanted to meet him. sorry if this is confusing!! and also my boyfriend has never met his dads gf ( my mom) knowing its his gf.

But being that your mom has only been with this guy for 2 months I would hope that she wouldn&#x27;t consider marrying this person, after 2 months you do not know a person well enough to get engaged.  You need to talk to her about this.  Also, my son&#x27;s father&#x27;s family has this going on in it too.  Not meaning to but all the rest of the family thinks its pretty sick.  And when one couple is having an issue and wants to go to their parent for advice it will more than likely start trouble for the parents too.  So not a good idea.

I think I would be more freaked out if I were your mom.  Are your mom and your boyfriend&#x27;s dad definitely getting married?  Living in the same house with your step brother boyfriend would be weird I think....stressfull having to see each other all of the time...maybe cool at first, but it would get old.  I&#x27;d be worried if I were your mom about the two of you living together doing who knows what when you&#x27;re alone.\r\n\r\nPerhaps you two can cool it for a while, see where your mom&#x27;s relatioship goes and take it from there.&quot;,&quot;attachedImageUrl&quot;:null,&quot;attachedImageId&quot;:null,&quot;reference&quot;:null,&quot;answerer&quot;:{&quot;euid&quot;:&quot;uwW0En8Lh103lDoaWERHTRgXAQ9IFHTIlpiW2CpbvQ--&quot;,&quot;kid&quot;:&quot;nOlwYnunaa&quot;,&quot;nickname&quot;:&quot;binkie&quot;,&quot;imageUrl&quot;:&quot;https://s.yimg.com/dh/ap/social/profile/profile_b48.png&quot;,&quot;level&quot;:3},&quot;isBestAnswer&quot;:false,&quot;thumbsDown&quot;:0,&quot;thumbsUp&quot;:1,&quot;isAnonymous&quot;:false,&quot;commentCount&quot;:0,&quot;createdTime&quot;:&quot;2009-01-25T17:08:58Z&quot;,&quot;userAnswerRelation&quot;:{&quot;hasFlagged&quot;:false,&quot;canFlag&quot;:true,&quot;canVote&quot;:false,&quot;canChooseBestAnswer&quot;:false,&quot;hasVoted&quot;:false,&quot;isAuthor&quot;:false,&quot;hasCommented&quot;:false,&quot;canComment&quot;:true}},{&quot;qid&quot;:&quot;20090125165610AAB8XDC&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;TltagNZPx1o1a8IAGITxALRejdnHQCYclpacpNkghmDQcTMLDPrepZw=&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;You are in a bit of a pickle.

Unfortunately, if they get married and you guys live together, things would be WAY too complicated and weird to keep your relationship going. I bet it&#x27;s happened more times than people realize, but unless you guys just don&#x27;t care, I&#x27;d say the wise thing might be to end it... since he will be your stepbrother - unless you live in West Virginia ;) lol jk.&quot;,&quot;attachedImageUrl&quot;:null,&quot;attachedImageId&quot;:null,&quot;reference&quot;:null,&quot;isBestAnswer&quot;:false,&quot;thumbsDown&quot;:0,&quot;thumbsUp&quot;:1,&quot;isAnonymous&quot;:true,&quot;commentCount&quot;:0,&quot;createdTime&quot;:&quot;2009-01-25T17:01:51Z&quot;,&quot;userAnswerRelation&quot;:{&quot;hasFlagged&quot;:false,&quot;canFlag&quot;:true,&quot;canVote&quot;:false,&quot;canChooseBestAnswer&quot;:false,&quot;hasVoted&quot;:false,&quot;isAuthor&quot;:false,&quot;hasCommented&quot;:false,&quot;canComment&quot;:true}},{&quot;qid&quot;:&quot;20090125165610AAB8XDC&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;3dfjywFPx1pV5QtmGMGSbYIwE5IWEHkTUOcKydtYuTLOoBo2CgZ1DuM=&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;nicely I would desire to confess, i replaced right into a ought to bit uncomfortable related to the Marcia and Greg element on the Brady Bunch action picture sequal, yet you&#x27;re actually not genetically on the subject be counted of him and weren&#x27;t raised with him.
