Put him in a high chair and give him something to eat.  I would bet money he is HUNGRY.  If babies are hungry they won&#39;t sleep.  At 9 months he should be eating more than pureed fruit.   AND furthermore, if he is hungry enough, he will eat vegis.   What? Can he get the jar and open it himself?   Of course not.   YOU control the food.  You control the environment.  And if you don&#39;t get this child under control SOON you will be in deep crap when he gets a bit older.  So what if he is stubborn??? You can be more so.   Just keep offering him the vegis.  Warm them a bit.  I can tell you though, he will probably want what you have on your plate more than that jarred stuff.  Feed it to him.  It won&#39;t hurt him.  Make sure it is soft I mean like don&#39;t give him meat or anything, but if you are eating cooked vegis, give him some.  Mashed potatoes, carrots, anything.  Express pleasure everytime you take a bite.. MMMMMMMMMMM this is SO GOOD.   He will eat it.  \r\nDon&#39;t hold him down to sleep.  Wear him out by playing.  Do you roll a ball for him?  Play with him and keep him active for sometime in the afternoon after dinner and before bedtime.  THEN give him a nice warm bath, powder him up, turn down the lights, give him a nice warm bottle, and read him a story...hold him in your lap while you are doing it.  He He will be sleepin in no time.  :)\r\nIf you need to talk, I am online in the evenings and mornings.

Baby Tylenol or Baby Ambesol for the teething.  He really is in pain, he&#39;s not just crying to annoy you.\r\n\r\nYou can wet a washcloth and freeze it for him to chew on.  You can wrap an ice cube or frozen cube of breastmilk or formula in a washcloth and secure it with a rubber band and offer that as a teether.\r\n\r\n2.  He&#39;s old enough to have table foods.  My son is 9 months old and he eats about as much as I do at a meal!  He eats whatever we&#39;re having for dinner.  Or if dinner is late, I open a can of veggies for him.\r\n\r\n3.

Either your baby has an illness that is making him particularly irritable (despite teething) or you&#39;re training his behavior by indulging his demands.  He&#39;s not supposed to run the show.  Let him scream.  Connect with your husband and build a solid front.  He&#39;s an infant and will do what works.  When screaming isn&#39;t working any more, he&#39;ll do something more charming.  It may take a week or less.  Who knows.  It may take longer, but you&#39;re going to have to put your foot down and be the mama, not the servant to a king baby.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Lovey"},"dateCreated":"2008-01-05T23:36:08Z","upvoteCount":2},{"@type":"Answer","text":"Instead of trying to make him into something he&#39;s obviously not, try to adapt somewhat to how he is.  Fighting with him obviously isn&#39;t working.  \r\nI threw out the books with my daughter.  My chores get done at night when she&#39;s in bed.   I spend one to two full hours on the floor with her.  She loves it.  She gets my full attention for that whole time, and I found that she&#39;s a much happier, content baby because of it.  I also discovered that it tires her out, so I&#39;m getting a much better nap and nighttime sleep out of her also.  Somedays I&#39;ve spend more than 2 hours on the floor with her (not all at once).  As for feeding...she skipped baby food and cereal altogether.  And everyone was horrified with me, and I don&#39;t care, but she wouldn&#39;t eat it.  So I gave her soft, small peices of pasta, and then toast.  She loves the Gerber cookies, Cheerios, soft cheese, yoghurt, applesauce.  \r\nTeething is hard.  My girl loses her appetite completely.  At first I worried, but then I though...she&#39;ll eat when she&#39;s hungry, and she does.  I don&#39;t force her.  There&#39;s no sense in forcing your boy to eat or do things he doesn&#39;t want to because some book told you to.  Every baby is different.  I don&#39;t listen to anybody but my baby. \r\nYour baby feels your stress.  They react to it.  If you love your baby and you want him happy, you have to ease up a little.  Your anger is upsetting him, and he&#39;s going to act up because of it.  \r\nI used homeopathic teething pills for my girl, and they worked wonders.  I also bought a little finger toothbrush and rubbed her gums a couple times a day to toughen them up.  \r\nI hope everything goes well.  Babies can be frustrating.  \r\nGood luck.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Anonymous"},"dateCreated":"2008-01-06T00:36:16Z","upvoteCount":1},{"@type":"Answer","text":"Sorry honey you have to be harder, turn your back on him when you eat, make the message clear you are eating and its your turn, dont give in.

off, stop feeding him baby foods.  Put him in a high chair and give him something to eat.  I would bet money he is HUNGRY.  If babies are hungry they won&#x27;t sleep.  At 9 months he should be eating more than pureed fruit.   AND furthermore, if he is hungry enough, he will eat vegis.   What? Can he get the jar and open it himself?   Of course not.   YOU control the food.  You control the environment.  And if you don&#x27;t get this child under control SOON you will be in deep crap when he gets a bit older.  So what if he is stubborn??? You can be more so.   Just keep offering him the vegis.  Warm them a bit.  I can tell you though, he will probably want what you have on your plate more than that jarred stuff.  Feed it to him.  It won&#x27;t hurt him.  Make sure it is soft I mean like don&#x27;t give him meat or anything, but if you are eating cooked vegis, give him some.  Mashed potatoes, carrots, anything.  Express pleasure everytime you take a bite.. MMMMMMMMMMM this is SO GOOD.   He will eat it.  </p><p>Don&#x27;t hold him down to sleep.  Wear him out by playing.  Do you roll a ball for him?  Play with him and keep him active for sometime in the afternoon after dinner and before bedtime.  THEN give him a nice warm bath, powder him up, turn down the lights, give him a nice warm bottle, and read him a story...hold him in your lap while you are doing it.  He He will be sleepin in no time.  :)</p><p>If you need to talk, I am online in the evenings and mornings.

Either your baby has an illness that is making him particularly irritable (despite teething) or you&#x27;re training his behavior by indulging his demands.  He&#x27;s not supposed to run the show.  Let him scream.  Connect with your husband and build a solid front.  He&#x27;s an infant and will do what works.  When screaming isn&#x27;t working any more, he&#x27;ll do something more charming.  It may take a week or less.  Who knows.  It may take longer, but you&#x27;re going to have to put your foot down and be the mama, not the servant to a king baby.</p></div><div class="AnswerActionBar__answerActionBarWrap___bd9es"><div class="AnswerActionBar__answerActionBar___1LrM2"><div class="AnswerActionBar__left___5SkAf"><button class="Buttons__linkBtn___1gAIw Buttons__btnBase___2Z659 Buttons__withIcon___3aIam" disabled="" aria-disabled="true" aria-label="Thumbs up for this answer." tabindex="-1"><svg class="Cur(p)" width="24" style="fill:#6e7780;stroke:#6e7780;stroke-width:0;vertical-align:bottom" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" data-icon="thumb-up"><path d="M23 10.9c0-1.6-1.6-2.6-3.2-2.6h-4.5c.4-1.1.5-2.5.3-4.1-.2-1.7-1.3-2.9-2.7-3.1-1.5-.2-2.8.6-2.8 2.1.1 1.3-.4 2.2-1.5 3.5-.1 0-.2.2-.4.3-.5.6-1.2 1.2-1.8 1.7l-.5.5H2.1c-.6 0-1.1.4-1.1 1V22c0 .5.5 1 1.1 1h4.2c.6 0 1.1-.4 1.1-1h10.8c1.4 0 2.7-.9 2.7-2.5 0-.4-.1-.8-.2-1.1.6-.4 1-1 1-1.7 0-.4-.1-.8-.3-1.1.6-.4 1-1 1-1.8 0-.4-.1-.8-.2-1.1.4-.5.8-1.1.8-1.8zm-2.7 2.6zM5.2 21H3.1v-9.9h2.1V21zm13-1H7.4v-9.4c.2-.1.3-.3.5-.4.6-.6 1.3-1.2 1.9-1.9.2-.1.3-.3.5-.5 1.4-1.6 2-3 2-4.8 0 0 0-.1.3 0 .5.1.9.5 1 1.4.3 2.1-.2 3.7-.6 4.1-.8.6-.3 1.7.7 1.7h6.2c.6 0 1.1.4 1.1.7s-.5.7-.6.7c-1.4 0-1.4 1.8-.1 2 0 .1.1.2.1.3s0 .2-.2.2c-.2.1-.4.1-.6.1-1.2 0-1.5 1.5-.4 1.9l.2.2c.2.1.2.3.2.5 0 .1-.1.1-.3.2-.2.1-.4.2-.6.2-1.1.1-1.2 1.6-.1 1.9l.1.1s.2.2.2.4c-.2.3-.4.4-.7.4z"></path></svg><span>2</span></button><button class="Buttons__linkBtn___1gAIw Buttons__btnBase___2Z659 Buttons__withIcon___3aIam" disabled="" aria-disabled="true" aria-label="Thumbs down for this answer." tabindex="-1"><svg class="Cur(p)" width="24" style="fill:#6e7780;stroke:#6e7780;stroke-width:0;vertical-align:bottom" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" data-icon="thumb-down"><path d="M1 13.1c0 1.6 1.6 2.6 3.2 2.6h4.5c-.4 1.1-.5 2.5-.3 4.1.2 1.7 1.3 2.9 2.7 3.1 1.5.2 2.8-.6 2.8-2.1-.1-1.3.4-2.2 1.5-3.5.1-.2.3-.3.4-.5.6-.6 1.2-1.2 1.8-1.7.2-.2.4-.3.6-.5H22c.6 0 1.1-.4 1.1-1V2c0-.5-.5-1-1.1-1h-4.2c-.6 0-1.1.4-1.1 1H5.9c-1.4 0-2.7.9-2.7 2.5 0 .4.1.8.2 1.1-.6.4-1 1-1 1.7 0 .4.1.8.3 1.1-.6.4-1 1-1 1.8 0 .4.1.8.2 1.1-.5.5-.9 1.1-.9 1.8zm2.7-2.6zM18.8 3h2.1v9.9h-2.1V3zm-13 1H16.6v9.4c-.2.1-.3.3-.5.4-.7.6-1.3 1.2-1.9 1.8l-.5.5c-1.4 1.6-2 3-2 4.8 0 0 0 .1-.3 0-.5-.1-.9-.5-1-1.4-.3-2.1.2-3.7.6-4.1.8-.6.3-1.7-.7-1.7H4.2c-.6 0-1.1-.4-1.1-.7s.5-.7.6-.7c1.4 0 1.4-1.8.1-2 0-.1-.1-.2-.1-.3s0-.2.2-.2c.2-.1.4-.1.6-.1 1.2.2 1.6-1.3.5-1.7l-.2-.2c-.2-.1-.3-.3-.3-.5 0-.1.1-.1.3-.2.2-.1.5-.2.6-.2 1.1-.1 1.2-1.6.1-1.9l-.1-.1s-.1-.2-.1-.4c0-.4.2-.5.5-.5z"></path></svg><span>2</span></button></div><div class="AnswerActionBar__right___nWVBY"><button class="Buttons__linkBtn___1gAIw Buttons__btnBase___2Z659 Buttons__withIcon___3aIam" disabled="" aria-disabled="true" aria-label="Report abuse." tabindex="-1"><svg class="Cur(p)" width="24" style="fill:#6e7780;stroke:#6e7780;stroke-width:0;vertical-align:bottom" height="24" viewBox="0 0 48 48" data-icon="flag"><path d="M40 10H28.62l-2.888-5-.008.004C25.38 4.407 24.74 4 24 4H8c-1.105 0-2 .896-2 2v36c0 1.105.895 2 2 2s2-.895 2-2V28h12.846l2.887 5c.357.62 1.018 1 1.732 1H40c1.105 0 2-.895 2-2V12c0-1.104-.895-2-2-2zm-2 20h-9.38l-2.888-5c-.357-.617-1.018-1-1.732-1H10V8h12.845l2.887 5c.37.642 1.04 1 1.732 1H38v16z"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></li><li><div class="Answer__answer___FdhNY"><div class="Answer__answerer___ZcKj-"><div class="UserProfile__container___1AkWy"><div class="UserProfile__profileWrapper___2XpWd"><div class="UserProfile__avatar___2gI-3"><span class="UserProfile__anonymousAvatarImg___3r5DJ"></span></div><div class="UserProfile__userInfo___PiPKv"><div class="UserProfile__userName___1d1RW">Anonymous</div></div></div><div class="UserProfile__childrenWrapper___2A5yC"><div class="Answer__subtitle___23J6D">1 decade ago</div></div></div></div><div class="ExpandableContent__content___2Iw4v" style="max-height:120px"><p>Instead of trying to make him into something he&#x27;s obviously not, try to adapt somewhat to how he is.  Fighting with him obviously isn&#x27;t working.  </p><p>I threw out the books with my daughter.  My chores get done at night when she&#x27;s in bed.   I spend one to two full hours on the floor with her.  She loves it.  She gets my full attention for that whole time, and I found that she&#x27;s a much happier, content baby because of it.  I also discovered that it tires her out, so I&#x27;m getting a much better nap and nighttime sleep out of her also.  Somedays I&#x27;ve spend more than 2 hours on the floor with her (not all at once).  As for feeding...she skipped baby food and cereal altogether.  And everyone was horrified with me, and I don&#x27;t care, but she wouldn&#x27;t eat it.  So I gave her soft, small peices of pasta, and then toast.  She loves the Gerber cookies, Cheerios, soft cheese, yoghurt, applesauce.  </p><p>Teething is hard.  My girl loses her appetite completely.  At first I worried, but then I though...she&#x27;ll eat when she&#x27;s hungry, and she does.  I don&#x27;t force her.  There&#x27;s no sense in forcing your boy to eat or do things he doesn&#x27;t want to because some book told you to.  Every baby is different.  I don&#x27;t listen to anybody but my baby. </p><p>Your baby feels your stress.  They react to it.  If you love your baby and you want him happy, you have to ease up a little.  Your anger is upsetting him, and he&#x27;s going to act up because of it.  </p><p>I used homeopathic teething pills for my girl, and they worked wonders.  I also bought a little finger toothbrush and rubbed her gums a couple times a day to toughen them up.  </p><p>I hope everything goes well.  Babies can be frustrating.  </p><p>Good luck.</p></div><div class="AnswerActionBar__answerActionBarWrap___bd9es"><div class="AnswerActionBar__answerActionBar___1LrM2"><div class="AnswerActionBar__left___5SkAf"><button class="Buttons__linkBtn___1gAIw Buttons__btnBase___2Z659 Buttons__withIcon___3aIam" disabled="" aria-disabled="true" aria-label="Thumbs up for this answer." tabindex="-1"><svg class="Cur(p)" width="24" style="fill:#6e7780;stroke:#6e7780;stroke-width:0;vertical-align:bottom" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" data-icon="thumb-up"><path d="M23 10.9c0-1.6-1.6-2.6-3.2-2.6h-4.5c.4-1.1.5-2.5.3-4.1-.2-1.7-1.3-2.9-2.7-3.1-1.5-.2-2.8.6-2.8 2.1.1 1.3-.4 2.2-1.5 3.5-.1 0-.2.2-.4.3-.5.6-1.2 1.2-1.8 1.7l-.5.5H2.1c-.6 0-1.1.4-1.1 1V22c0 .5.5 1 1.1 1h4.2c.6 0 1.1-.4 1.1-1h10.8c1.4 0 2.7-.9 2.7-2.5 0-.4-.1-.8-.2-1.1.6-.4 1-1 1-1.7 0-.4-.1-.8-.3-1.1.6-.4 1-1 1-1.8 0-.4-.1-.8-.2-1.1.4-.5.8-1.1.8-1.8zm-2.7 2.6zM5.2 21H3.1v-9.9h2.1V21zm13-1H7.4v-9.4c.2-.1.3-.3.5-.4.6-.6 1.3-1.2 1.9-1.9.2-.1.3-.3.5-.5 1.4-1.6 2-3 2-4.8 0 0 0-.1.3 0 .5.1.9.5 1 1.4.3 2.1-.2 3.7-.6 4.1-.8.6-.3 1.7.7 1.7h6.2c.6 0 1.1.4 1.1.7s-.5.7-.6.7c-1.4 0-1.4 1.8-.1 2 0 .1.1.2.1.3s0 .2-.2.2c-.2.1-.4.1-.6.1-1.2 0-1.5 1.5-.4 1.9l.2.2c.2.1.2.3.2.5 0 .1-.1.1-.3.2-.2.1-.4.2-.6.2-1.1.1-1.2 1.6-.1 1.9l.1.1s.2.2.2.4c-.2.3-.4.4-.7.4z"></path></svg><span>1</span></button><button class="Buttons__linkBtn___1gAIw Buttons__btnBase___2Z659 Buttons__withIcon___3aIam" disabled="" aria-disabled="true" aria-label="Thumbs down for this answer." tabindex="-1"><svg class="Cur(p)" width="24" style="fill:#6e7780;stroke:#6e7780;stroke-width:0;vertical-align:bottom" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" data-icon="thumb-down"><path d="M1 13.1c0 1.6 1.6 2.6 3.2 2.6h4.5c-.4 1.1-.5 2.5-.3 4.1.2 1.7 1.3 2.9 2.7 3.1 1.5.2 2.8-.6 2.8-2.1-.1-1.3.4-2.2 1.5-3.5.1-.2.3-.3.4-.5.6-.6 1.2-1.2 1.8-1.7.2-.2.4-.3.6-.5H22c.6 0 1.1-.4 1.1-1V2c0-.5-.5-1-1.1-1h-4.2c-.6 0-1.1.4-1.1 1H5.9c-1.4 0-2.7.9-2.7 2.5 0 .4.1.8.2 1.1-.6.4-1 1-1 1.7 0 .4.1.8.3 1.1-.6.4-1 1-1 1.8 0 .4.1.8.2 1.1-.5.5-.9 1.1-.9 1.8zm2.7-2.6zM18.8 3h2.1v9.9h-2.1V3zm-13 1H16.6v9.4c-.2.1-.3.3-.5.4-.7.6-1.3 1.2-1.9 1.8l-.5.5c-1.4 1.6-2 3-2 4.8 0 0 0 .1-.3 0-.5-.1-.9-.5-1-1.4-.3-2.1.2-3.7.6-4.1.8-.6.3-1.7-.7-1.7H4.2c-.6 0-1.1-.4-1.1-.7s.5-.7.6-.7c1.4 0 1.4-1.8.1-2 0-.1-.1-.2-.1-.3s0-.2.2-.2c.2-.1.4-.1.6-.1 1.2.2 1.6-1.3.5-1.7l-.2-.2c-.2-.1-.3-.3-.3-.5 0-.1.1-.1.3-.2.2-.1.5-.2.6-.2 1.1-.1 1.2-1.6.1-1.9l-.1-.1s-.1-.2-.1-.4c0-.4.2-.5.5-.5z"></path></svg><span>0</span></button></div><div class="AnswerActionBar__right___nWVBY"><button class="Buttons__linkBtn___1gAIw Buttons__btnBase___2Z659 Buttons__withIcon___3aIam" disabled="" aria-disabled="true" aria-label="Report abuse." tabindex="-1"><svg class="Cur(p)" width="24" style="fill:#6e7780;stroke:#6e7780;stroke-width:0;vertical-align:bottom" height="24" viewBox="0 0 48 48" data-icon="flag"><path d="M40 10H28.62l-2.888-5-.008.004C25.38 4.407 24.74 4 24 4H8c-1.105 0-2 .896-2 2v36c0 1.105.895 2 2 2s2-.895 2-2V28h12.846l2.887 5c.357.62 1.018 1 1.732 1H40c1.105 0 2-.895 2-2V12c0-1.104-.895-2-2-2zm-2 20h-9.38l-2.888-5c-.357-.617-1.018-1-1.732-1H10V8h12.845l2.887 5c.37.642 1.04 1 1.732 1H38v16z"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></li><li><div class="Answer__answer___FdhNY"><div class="Answer__answerer___ZcKj-"><div class="UserProfile__container___1AkWy"><div class="UserProfile__profileWrapper___2XpWd" style="cursor:pointer"><div class="UserProfile__avatar___2gI-3"><a href="/activity/questions?show=0KH47inZaa" aria-label="Visit debjpage&#x27;s profile page."><img src="https://s.yimg.com/ag/images/4542/24894507888_ec3d4c_128sq.jpg" alt="debjpage&#x27;s avatar" aria-hidden="true"/></a></div><div class="UserProfile__userInfo___PiPKv"><a class="UserProfile__userName___1d1RW" href="/activity/questions?show=0KH47inZaa">debjpage</a></div></div><div class="UserProfile__childrenWrapper___2A5yC"><div class="Answer__subtitle___23J6D">1 decade ago</div></div></div></div><div class="ExpandableContent__content___2Iw4v" style="max-height:120px"><p>Sorry honey you have to be harder, turn your back on him when you eat, make the message clear you are eating and its your turn, dont give in.

Put him in a high chair and give him something to eat.  I would bet money he is HUNGRY.  If babies are hungry they won&#x27;t sleep.  At 9 months he should be eating more than pureed fruit.   AND furthermore, if he is hungry enough, he will eat vegis.   What? Can he get the jar and open it himself?   Of course not.   YOU control the food.  You control the environment.  And if you don&#x27;t get this child under control SOON you will be in deep crap when he gets a bit older.  So what if he is stubborn??? You can be more so.   Just keep offering him the vegis.  Warm them a bit.  I can tell you though, he will probably want what you have on your plate more than that jarred stuff.  Feed it to him.  It won&#x27;t hurt him.  Make sure it is soft I mean like don&#x27;t give him meat or anything, but if you are eating cooked vegis, give him some.  Mashed potatoes, carrots, anything.  Express pleasure everytime you take a bite.. MMMMMMMMMMM this is SO GOOD.   He will eat it.  \r\nDon&#x27;t hold him down to sleep.  Wear him out by playing.  Do you roll a ball for him?  Play with him and keep him active for sometime in the afternoon after dinner and before bedtime.  THEN give him a nice warm bath, powder him up, turn down the lights, give him a nice warm bottle, and read him a story...hold him in your lap while you are doing it.  He He will be sleepin in no time.  :)\r\nIf you need to talk, I am online in the evenings and mornings.  Holler at me ;)\r\nGOOOOOOD LUCK honey.\r\n\r\nKaren&quot;,&quot;attachedImageUrl&quot;:null,&quot;attachedImageId&quot;:null,&quot;reference&quot;:null,&quot;answerer&quot;:{&quot;euid&quot;:&quot;ByshoDBpm1Q2Ka4sqdspTZZzNtBEuRWP0jUjt61QpQ--&quot;,&quot;kid&quot;:&quot;3342a98d3a173fa43509f0af219b81a9aa&quot;,&quot;nickname&quot;:&quot;Karen&quot;,&quot;imageUrl&quot;:&quot;https://s.yimg.com/ag/images/4681/39048487551_7b9535_128sq.jpg&quot;,&quot;level&quot;:4},&quot;isBestAnswer&quot;:false,&quot;thumbsDown&quot;:1,&quot;thumbsUp&quot;:1,&quot;isAnonymous&quot;:false,&quot;commentCount&quot;:0,&quot;createdTime&quot;:&quot;2008-01-05T23:47:23Z&quot;,&quot;userAnswerRelation&quot;:{&quot;hasFlagged&quot;:false,&quot;canFlag&quot;:true,&quot;canVote&quot;:false,&quot;canChooseBestAnswer&quot;:false,&quot;hasVoted&quot;:false,&quot;isAuthor&quot;:false,&quot;hasCommented&quot;:false,&quot;canComment&quot;:true}},{&quot;qid&quot;:&quot;20080105232652AAZyjhx&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;jkKrgPFPx1qbObuyN4hUIWO_PLv1Aq17G-AkFmdxvd_r9bEreL2HvYU=&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;I&#x27;m sorry you&#x27;re having a rough time right now.\r\n\r\n1.  Baby Tylenol or Baby Ambesol for the teething.  He really is in pain, he&#x27;s not just crying to annoy you.\r\n\r\nYou can wet a washcloth and freeze it for him to chew on.  You can wrap an ice cube or frozen cube of breastmilk or formula in a washcloth and secure it with a rubber band and offer that as a teether.\r\n\r\n2.  He&#x27;s old enough to have table foods.  My son is 9 months old and he eats about as much as I do at a meal!  He eats whatever we&#x27;re having for dinner.  Or if dinner is late, I open a can of veggies for him.\r\n\r\n3.  It sounds as if he overstimulates easily.  Do you give him quiet times - a couple hours with no TV, radio, or \&quot;talking\&quot; toys?&quot;,&quot;attachedImageUrl&quot;:null,&quot;attachedImageId&quot;:null,&quot;reference&quot;:null,&quot;answerer&quot;:{&quot;euid&quot;:&quot;EwPR6nR7mFFVI7Hd00JG0.mWMlDxsc72XxfIIfDFOw--&quot;,&quot;kid&quot;:&quot;x7KQzsEhaa&quot;,&quot;nickname&quot;:&quot;buterfly_2_lovely&quot;,&quot;imageUrl&quot;:&quot;https://s.yimg.com/ag/images/4538/37846530140_b1fcc3_128sq.jpg&quot;,&quot;level&quot;:4},&quot;isBestAnswer&quot;:false,&quot;thumbsDown&quot;:0,&quot;thumbsUp&quot;:1,&quot;isAnonymous&quot;:false,&quot;commentCount&quot;:0,&quot;createdTime&quot;:&quot;2008-01-06T00:57:28Z&quot;,&quot;userAnswerRelation&quot;:{&quot;hasFlagged&quot;:false,&quot;canFlag&quot;:true,&quot;canVote&quot;:false,&quot;canChooseBestAnswer&quot;:false,&quot;hasVoted&quot;:false,&quot;isAuthor&quot;:false,&quot;hasCommented&quot;:false,&quot;canComment&quot;:true}},{&quot;qid&quot;:&quot;20080105232652AAZyjhx&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;uc7g8alPx1puzHEwgNWcC72pJFSnkhCoCGIIObqMUH0vPfv7JEEJLEA=&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Ma&#x27;am, in my own humble opinion, this sounds like one of two things.  Either your baby has an illness that is making him particularly irritable (despite teething) or you&#x27;re training his behavior by indulging his demands.  He&#x27;s not supposed to run the show.  Let him scream.  Connect with your husband and build a solid front.  He&#x27;s an infant and will do what works.  When screaming isn&#x27;t working any more, he&#x27;ll do something more charming.  It may take a week or less.  Who knows.  It may take longer, but you&#x27;re going to have to put your foot down and be the mama, not the servant to a king baby.&quot;,&quot;attachedImageUrl&quot;:null,&quot;attachedImageId&quot;:null,&quot;reference&quot;:null,&quot;answerer&quot;:{&quot;euid&quot;:&quot;3H53sDIIjV1IDJUjw.DS4hkMxL3YcohDlCIhackyJA--&quot;,&quot;kid&quot;:&quot;GhZQGu9Maa&quot;,&quot;nickname&quot;:&quot;Lovey&quot;,&quot;imageUrl&quot;:&quot;https://s.yimg.com/dh/ap/social/profile/profile_b48.png&quot;,&quot;level&quot;:5},&quot;isBestAnswer&quot;:false,&quot;thumbsDown&quot;:2,&quot;thumbsUp&quot;:2,&quot;isAnonymous&quot;:false,&quot;commentCount&quot;:0,&quot;createdTime&quot;:&quot;2008-01-05T23:36:08Z&quot;,&quot;userAnswerRelation&quot;:{&quot;hasFlagged&quot;:false,&quot;canFlag&quot;:true,&quot;canVote&quot;:false,&quot;canChooseBestAnswer&quot;:false,&quot;hasVoted&quot;:false,&quot;isAuthor&quot;:false,&quot;hasCommented&quot;:false,&quot;canComment&quot;:true}},{&quot;qid&quot;:&quot;20080105232652AAZyjhx&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;-CalBbpPx1pRrlFGxDB3CmrS2mVysCxeKGxq69b23-TClz4ADO1Pw6A=&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Instead of trying to make him into something he&#x27;s obviously not, try to adapt somewhat to how he is.  Fighting with him obviously isn&#x27;t working.  \r\nI threw out the books with my daughter.  My chores get done at night when she&#x27;s in bed.   I spend one to two full hours on the floor with her.  She loves it.  She gets my full attention for that whole time, and I found that she&#x27;s a much happier, content baby because of it.  I also discovered that it tires her out, so I&#x27;m getting a much better nap and nighttime sleep out of her also.  Somedays I&#x27;ve spend more than 2 hours on the floor with her (not all at once).  As for feeding...she skipped baby food and cereal altogether.  And everyone was horrified with me, and I don&#x27;t care, but she wouldn&#x27;t eat it.  So I gave her soft, small peices of pasta, and then toast.  She loves the Gerber cookies, Cheerios, soft cheese, yoghurt, applesauce.  \r\nTeething is hard.  My girl loses her appetite completely.  At first I worried, but then I though...she&#x27;ll eat when she&#x27;s hungry, and she does.  I don&#x27;t force her.  There&#x27;s no sense in forcing your boy to eat or do things he doesn&#x27;t want to because some book told you to.  Every baby is different.  I don&#x27;t listen to anybody but my baby. \r\nYour baby feels your stress.  They react to it.  If you love your baby and you want him happy, you have to ease up a little.  Your anger is upsetting him, and he&#x27;s going to act up because of it.  \r\nI used homeopathic teething pills for my girl, and they worked wonders.  I also bought a little finger toothbrush and rubbed her gums a couple times a day to toughen them up.  \r\nI hope everything goes well.  Babies can be frustrating.  \r\nGood luck.&quot;,&quot;attachedImageUrl&quot;:null,&quot;attachedImageId&quot;:null,&quot;reference&quot;:null,&quot;isBestAnswer&quot;:false,&quot;thumbsDown&quot;:0,&quot;thumbsUp&quot;:1,&quot;isAnonymous&quot;:true,&quot;commentCount&quot;:0,&quot;createdTime&quot;:&quot;2008-01-06T00:36:16Z&quot;,&quot;userAnswerRelation&quot;:{&quot;hasFlagged&quot;:false,&quot;canFlag&quot;:true,&quot;canVote&quot;:false,&quot;canChooseBestAnswer&quot;:false,&quot;hasVoted&quot;:false,&quot;isAuthor&quot;:false,&quot;hasCommented&quot;:false,&quot;canComment&quot;:true}},{&quot;qid&quot;:&quot;20080105232652AAZyjhx&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;O-KEULdPx1q_vgp6JdUNru4pbPIktiD-x5XAlGTF72qOI96l280y04I=&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Sorry honey you have to be harder, turn your back on him when you eat, make the message clear you are eating and its your turn, dont give in.
