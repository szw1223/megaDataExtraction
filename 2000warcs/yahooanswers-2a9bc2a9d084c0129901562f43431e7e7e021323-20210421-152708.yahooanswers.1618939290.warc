I think he&#39;s a very lucky kitty that he has his own room! :)\r\n\r\nBut maybe you should be careful about him clawing at the couch or knocking things down even in his room, because he might think that it&#39;s the way it is and there are no rules for him to follow, and he might not understand why you get angry when he claws the couch in the living room.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"blah"},"dateCreated":"2012-06-21T05:03:16Z","upvoteCount":0},"suggestedAnswer":[{"@type":"Answer","text":"3 weeks is relatively rather younger. I do not feel i would call her mean yet, however as a substitute unsocialized. We got an eight week kitten (more or less) from the humane society about a month ago and he or she&#39;s a little bit of a terror. However she&#39;s studying - she is more careful together with her claws, however she still likes to bite. I try to maintain whatever helpful for her to gnaw on. If I think she is getting carried away I faucet her nose firmly and say no and put her down. That seems to be working (slowly). Perhaps you must get some of these cat deal with things and make contact with the cat for a treat and pet her a bit. Then just go away and then do it once more in a whilst.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"?"},"dateCreated":"2016-07-21T02:25:08Z","upvoteCount":0},{"@type":"Answer","text":"I don&#39;t think it&#39;s mean.

And you don&#39;t keep him in there all the time so I don&#39;t see how it&#39;s bad.

I do not feel i would call her mean yet, however as a substitute unsocialized. We got an eight week kitten (more or less) from the humane society about a month ago and he or she&#x27;s a little bit of a terror. However she&#x27;s studying - she is more careful together with her claws, however she still likes to bite. I try to maintain whatever helpful for her to gnaw on. If I think she is getting carried away I faucet her nose firmly and say no and put her down. That seems to be working (slowly). Perhaps you must get some of these cat deal with things and make contact with the cat for a treat and pet her a bit.

My point is that he can&#x27;t differentiate between old and new.  Does he have plenty of toys outside of his room?  Oftentimes owners give their pets old socks and shoes to play with and chew but the poor little creature doesn&#x27;t know the difference between an old pair of tennis shoes and a new pair of

this mean to my kitten?&quot;,&quot;content&quot;:&quot;My kitten is about 7 months old and whenever I go out or at night when I go to bed I put my kitten in his own room, it&#x27;s about the size of half a big bedroom, so it&#x27;s pretty big for a kitten and it has everything he needs, he has food, water, his litter box, a bed, lots of toys and an old couch that he can play on, claw at and sleep on. \r\nWhenever I&#x27;m home I don&#x27;t put him in his room and let him go outside if he wants. If I don&#x27;t put him in his room he knocks stuff over, chews on stuff he shouldn&#x27;t (like computer/electric cables, hair ties and hair clips) and claws at couches and chairs he shouldn&#x27;t.\r\nAlso at night he goes completely crazy and he attacks pretty much everything he sees, but when I put him in is room he goes to sleep and doesn&#x27;t meow. \r\nIs this mean to my kitten?&quot;,&quot;updatedDetails&quot;:[],&quot;attachedImageUrl&quot;:null,&quot;bestAnswer&quot;:{&quot;qid&quot;:&quot;20120621044145AA6BWYm&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;nWl90bBPx1rZEzu_na4rMJbnRPPxpZQHWEY3vUD8-9G67VBsWoRqmvg=&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;I don&#x27;t think it is mean, some over the top cat owners may have made you feel that way, after all, you&#x27;re not worried that the cat will harm your stuff, you&#x27;re worried that he might get shocked biting on an electric cable, or swallow a hair clip (-I&#x27;m thinking). I think he&#x27;s a very lucky kitty that he has his own room! :)\r\n\r\nBut maybe you should be careful about him clawing at the couch or knocking things down even in his room, because he might think that it&#x27;s the way it is and there are no rules for him to follow, and he might not understand why you get angry when he claws the couch in the living room.&quot;,&quot;attachedImageUrl&quot;:null,&quot;attachedImageId&quot;:null,&quot;reference&quot;:&quot;cat owner&quot;,&quot;answerer&quot;:{&quot;euid&quot;:&quot;6NiWk21.nVazHQjQ8yvGsVGYKqaX.GYHL0C6ntKRgw--&quot;,&quot;kid&quot;:&quot;fN7t1HtIaa&quot;,&quot;nickname&quot;:&quot;blah&quot;,&quot;imageUrl&quot;:&quot;https://s.yimg.com/ag/images/default_user_profile_pic_128sq.jpg&quot;,&quot;level&quot;:3},&quot;isBestAnswer&quot;:true,&quot;thumbsDown&quot;:0,&quot;thumbsUp&quot;:0,&quot;isAnonymous&quot;:false,&quot;commentCount&quot;:0,&quot;createdTime&quot;:&quot;2012-06-21T05:03:16Z&quot;,&quot;userAnswerRelation&quot;:{&quot;hasFlagged&quot;:false,&quot;canFlag&quot;:true,&quot;canVote&quot;:false,&quot;canChooseBestAnswer&quot;:false,&quot;hasVoted&quot;:false,&quot;isAuthor&quot;:false,&quot;hasCommented&quot;:false,&quot;canComment&quot;:true},&quot;bestAnswerAwardTimestamp&quot;:1340772775000},&quot;isLocked&quot;:true,&quot;saveCount&quot;:0,&quot;isAnonymous&quot;:true,&quot;canChooseBestAnswer&quot;:false,&quot;userQuestionRelation&quot;:{&quot;canAnswer&quot;:true,&quot;hasAnswered&quot;:false,&quot;hasFlagged&quot;:false,&quot;hasStarred&quot;:false,&quot;isAuthor&quot;:false},&quot;saveBtnError&quot;:null,&quot;anonymousBtnError&quot;:null,&quot;updateError&quot;:null,&quot;deleteError&quot;:null,&quot;postAnswerError&quot;:null,&quot;reportAbuseError&quot;:null,&quot;setCategoryError&quot;:null,&quot;postQuestionError&quot;:null,&quot;isUpdating&quot;:false,&quot;isUpdateDone&quot;:false,&quot;isChoosingBestAnswer&quot;:false,&quot;isDeleting&quot;:false,&quot;isDeleteDone&quot;:false,&quot;isPostingAnswer&quot;:false,&quot;isPostAnswerDone&quot;:false,&quot;isSettingCategory&quot;:false,&quot;isSetCategoryDone&quot;:false,&quot;isPostingQuestion&quot;:false,&quot;isPostQuestionDone&quot;:false,&quot;categoryAssocSpaceId&quot;:2115300554,&quot;answerCount&quot;:16},&quot;extraQuestions&quot;:{&quot;keys&quot;:[],&quot;byKey&quot;:{}},&quot;questionAnswersList&quot;:{&quot;20120621044145AA6BWYm&quot;:{&quot;qid&quot;:&quot;20120621044145AA6BWYm&quot;,&quot;count&quot;:10,&quot;answerCount&quot;:16,&quot;start&quot;:1,&quot;lang&quot;:&quot;en-GB&quot;,&quot;sortType&quot;:&quot;RELEVANCE&quot;,&quot;answers&quot;:[{&quot;qid&quot;:&quot;20120621044145AA6BWYm&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;TWIMnFNPx1rU9v5ZHEaNcgJG40fhZfmHe5eT6tMhrocXA9F1eIr92jg=&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;3 weeks is relatively rather younger. I do not feel i would call her mean yet, however as a substitute unsocialized. We got an eight week kitten (more or less) from the humane society about a month ago and he or she&#x27;s a little bit of a terror. However she&#x27;s studying - she is more careful together with her claws, however she still likes to bite. I try to maintain whatever helpful for her to gnaw on. If I think she is getting carried away I faucet her nose firmly and say no and put her down. That seems to be working (slowly). Perhaps you must get some of these cat deal with things and make contact with the cat for a treat and pet her a bit. Then just go away and then do it once more in a whilst.&quot;,&quot;attachedImageUrl&quot;:null,&quot;attachedImageId&quot;:null,&quot;reference&quot;:null,&quot;answerer&quot;:{&quot;euid&quot;:&quot;LHJP9I1xlkG3dxpxQh5dDHH9keACqY95bnjkbZVbyA--&quot;,&quot;kid&quot;:&quot;qIkOsd20aa&quot;,&quot;nickname&quot;:&quot;?&quot;,&quot;imageUrl&quot;:&quot;https://s.yimg.com/dh/ap/social/profile/profile_b48.png&quot;,&quot;level&quot;:4},&quot;isBestAnswer&quot;:false,&quot;thumbsDown&quot;:0,&quot;thumbsUp&quot;:0,&quot;isAnonymous&quot;:false,&quot;commentCount&quot;:0,&quot;createdTime&quot;:&quot;2016-07-21T02:25:08Z&quot;,&quot;userAnswerRelation&quot;:{&quot;hasFlagged&quot;:false,&quot;canFlag&quot;:true,&quot;canVote&quot;:false,&quot;canChooseBestAnswer&quot;:false,&quot;hasVoted&quot;:false,&quot;isAuthor&quot;:false,&quot;hasCommented&quot;:false,&quot;canComment&quot;:true}},{&quot;qid&quot;:&quot;20120621044145AA6BWYm&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;E7dO3hBPx1oX5LG8CDWWzjL6H5Ly5ldjMVIBJg1bNrtx2S8BoXm27jI=&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s mean. I have two kittens, both 6 months and they can get pretty rowdy at night. I don&#x27;t think it matters what room you put it in at night, as long as it has everything it needs, which you said it does. And you don&#x27;t keep him in there all the time so I don&#x27;t see how it&#x27;s bad. I had to do this with my kittens when they were younger because they&#x27;d jump on me and destroy my house when I went to bed.&quot;,&quot;attachedImageUrl&quot;:null,&quot;attachedImageId&quot;:null,&quot;reference&quot;:null,&quot;answerer&quot;:{&quot;euid&quot;:&quot;eYlfTMBx.0YfhiDqBIlvfbx9b7CbHcY2Gx5YkbB20Q--&quot;,&quot;kid&quot;:&quot;vNgF6pBzaa&quot;,&quot;nickname&quot;:&quot;Jenn&quot;,&quot;imageUrl&quot;:&quot;https://s.yimg.com/ag/images/default_user_profile_pic_128sq.jpg&quot;,&quot;level&quot;:1},&quot;isBestAnswer&quot;:false,&quot;thumbsDown&quot;:0,&quot;thumbsUp&quot;:0,&quot;isAnonymous&quot;:false,&quot;commentCount&quot;:0,&quot;createdTime&quot;:&quot;2012-06-21T04:48:14Z&quot;,&quot;userAnswerRelation&quot;:{&quot;hasFlagged&quot;:false,&quot;canFlag&quot;:true,&quot;canVote&quot;:false,&quot;canChooseBestAnswer&quot;:false,&quot;hasVoted&quot;:false,&quot;isAuthor&quot;:false,&quot;hasCommented&quot;:false,&quot;canComment&quot;:true}},{&quot;qid&quot;:&quot;20120621044145AA6BWYm&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;jKuxJnFPx1q9JjtIFwYOEUPRzBA5Q0sOp26nb3uEklfJwhOyG6Hcy6I=&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;No, leaving him alone is perfectly normal and not cruel at all. \r\nHe is simply having a kitten tantrum (aww!) about being left alone. At seven months however, he should be perfectly capable of being alone. You aren&#x27;t being mean at all, don&#x27;t worry.\r\nThe only thing I think would help this is to make sure everything available to be ruined and attacked by the kitten is out of the room - and just to leave him at it. He will eventually realise that his antics don&#x27;t get him his own way.\r\n\r\nGood luck, and I hope everything goes well!&quot;,&quot;attachedImageUrl&quot;:null,&quot;attachedImageId&quot;:null,&quot;reference&quot;:null,&quot;isBestAnswer&quot;:false,&quot;thumbsDown&quot;:0,&quot;thumbsUp&quot;:0,&quot;isAnonymous&quot;:true,&quot;commentCount&quot;:0,&quot;createdTime&quot;:&quot;2012-06-21T04:47:07Z&quot;,&quot;userAnswerRelation&quot;:{&quot;hasFlagged&quot;:false,&quot;canFlag&quot;:true,&quot;canVote&quot;:false,&quot;canChooseBestAnswer&quot;:false,&quot;hasVoted&quot;:false,&quot;isAuthor&quot;:false,&quot;hasCommented&quot;:false,&quot;canComment&quot;:true}},{&quot;qid&quot;:&quot;20120621044145AA6BWYm&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;NQ2OuSJPx1qUDddxFWlfMkAorsnRgS8KCqx5pXTqTyXIBj8HnQfilxw=&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;I dnt think this is cruel..

You mention all sorts of things he chews on that he is not supposed to outside his room.  What about inside his room; does he have many of the same things but \&quot;old, used\&quot; versions?  My point is that he can&#x27;t differentiate between old and new.  Does he have plenty of toys outside of his room?  Oftentimes owners give their pets old socks and shoes to play with and chew but the poor little creature doesn&#x27;t know the difference between an old pair of tennis shoes and a new pair of Pradas.&quot;,&quot;attachedImageUrl&quot;:null,&quot;attachedImageId&quot;:null,&quot;reference&quot;:null,&quot;answerer&quot;:{&quot;euid&quot;:&quot;Fah75r53hkBCB6JBmvxmuW1pqbJ86z4WTrf5KngfyA--&quot;,&quot;kid&quot;:&quot;QTH6DjQlaa&quot;,&quot;nickname&quot;:&quot;the DT&quot;,&quot;imageUrl&quot;:&quot;https://s.yimg.com/ag/images/4516/37356556273_6e36f7_128sq.jpg&quot;,&quot;level&quot;:7},&quot;isBestAnswer&quot;:false,&quot;thumbsDown&quot;:0,&quot;thumbsUp&quot;:0,&quot;isAnonymous&quot;:false,&quot;commentCount&quot;:0,&quot;createdTime&quot;:&quot;2012-06-21T04:52:49Z&quot;,&quot;userAnswerRelation&quot;:{&quot;hasFlagged&quot;:false,&quot;canFlag&quot;:true,&quot;canVote&quot;:false,&quot;canChooseBestAnswer&quot;:false,&quot;hasVoted&quot;:false,&quot;isAuthor&quot;:false,&quot;hasCommented&quot;:false,&quot;canComment&quot;:true}},{&quot;qid&quot;:&quot;20120621044145AA6BWYm&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;9HM5PzJPx1pKaTww3UBbmDU4JZ_NmnKuzcCG_QZFLNNT197CB0o-hoA=&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Putting a kitten in it&#x27;s own room isn&#x27;t mean&quot;,&quot;attachedImageUrl&quot;:null,&quot;attachedImageId&quot;:null,&quot;reference&quot;:null,&quot;isBestAnswer&quot;:false,&quot;thumbsDown&quot;:0,&quot;thumbsUp&quot;:1,&quot;isAnonymous&quot;:true,&quot;commentCount&quot;:0,&quot;createdTime&quot;:&quot;2012-06-21T04:44:36Z&quot;,&quot;userAnswerRelation&quot;:{&quot;hasFlagged&quot;:false,&quot;canFlag&quot;:true,&quot;canVote&quot;:false,&quot;canChooseBestAnswer&quot;:false,&quot;hasVoted&quot;:false,&quot;isAuthor&quot;:false,&quot;hasCommented&quot;:false,&quot;canComment&quot;:true}},{&quot;qid&quot;:&quot;20120621044145AA6BWYm&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;wrr30VxPx1obrLsC_XJJa2mhVHr92Q-jHXg-ZsVG08cjfZdVrelNktY=&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;no you doing the right thing putting him the room at night with all the toys food water a tray . and as he sleeps all night he sound happy there .&quot;,&quot;attachedImageUrl&quot;:null,&quot;attachedImageId&quot;:null,&quot;reference&quot;:null,&quot;answerer&quot;:{&quot;euid&quot;:&quot;.CrxJo96iEwF_X1OT0TejHJgxZyJv0PPCVXbhc.D9Q--&quot;,&quot;kid&quot;:&quot;7a4cOG45aa&quot;,&quot;nickname&quot;:&quot;iceni&quot;,&quot;imageUrl&quot;:&quot;https://s.yimg.com/ag/images/4684/24307849707_5c405a_128sq.jpg&quot;,&quot;level&quot;:4},&quot;isBestAnswer&quot;:false,&quot;thumbsDown&quot;:0,&quot;thumbsUp&quot;:0,&quot;isAnonymous&quot;:false,&quot;commentCount&quot;:0,&quot;createdTime&quot;:&quot;2012-06-21T04:45:02Z&quot;,&quot;userAnswerRelation&quot;:{&quot;hasFlagged&quot;:false,&quot;canFlag&quot;:true,&quot;canVote&quot;:false,&quot;canChooseBestAnswer&quot;:false,&quot;hasVoted&quot;:false,&quot;isAuthor&quot;:false,&quot;hasCommented&quot;:false,&quot;canComment&quot;:true}},{&quot;qid&quot;:&quot;20120621044145AA6BWYm&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;h_jibBNPx1plCnVgSkqmB6N1FbIXcG4FQjOXn9A8TnlIHPg9iQBT9JBAr7R-9SDHT52sQ-yYFada8NUQ51bErcg=&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;This is normal for a kitten and it seems like he likes his room !&quot;,&quot;attachedImageUrl&quot;:null,&quot;attachedImageId&quot;:null,&quot;reference&quot;:null,&quot;answerer&quot;:{&quot;euid&quot;:&quot;RVaEMYlqhlkOpMmG4eyvu4VjA.tEXZvdwL.zEPlzEA--&quot;,&quot;kid&quot;:&quot;6983dd987efb5ed763e7b22625b09401aa&quot;,&quot;nickname&quot;:&quot;Simon C&quot;,&quot;imageUrl&quot;:&quot;https://s.yimg.com/dh/ap/social/profile/profile_b48.png&quot;,&quot;level&quot;:4},&quot;isBestAnswer&quot;:false,&quot;thumbsDown&quot;:0,&quot;thumbsUp&quot;:0,&quot;isAnonymous&quot;:false,&quot;commentCount&quot;:0,&quot;createdTime&quot;:&quot;2012-06-21T04:52:20Z&quot;,&quot;userAnswerRelation&quot;:{&quot;hasFlagged&quot;:false,&quot;canFlag&quot;:true,&quot;canVote&quot;:false,&quot;canChooseBestAnswer&quot;:false,&quot;hasVoted&quot;:false,&quot;isAuthor&quot;:false,&quot;hasCommented&quot;:false,&quot;canComment&quot;:true}},{&quot;qid&quot;:&quot;20120621044145AA6BWYm&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;SxYSPE9Px1pstOSUN05HyMPLIiuvUUwpSKXDvoXlMiZnmE1fEpd0qVc=&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;I think when it rampages at night its just his way of saying he wants to go in his room.

I think he&#39;s a very lucky kitty that he has his own room! :)\r\n\r\nBut maybe you should be careful about him clawing at the couch or knocking things down even in his room, because he might think that it&#39;s the way it is and there are no rules for him to follow, and he might not understand why you get angry when he claws the couch in the living room.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"blah"},"dateCreated":"2012-06-21T05:03:16Z","upvoteCount":0},"suggestedAnswer":[{"@type":"Answer","text":"3 weeks is relatively rather younger. I do not feel i would call her mean yet, however as a substitute unsocialized. We got an eight week kitten (more or less) from the humane society about a month ago and he or she&#39;s a little bit of a terror. However she&#39;s studying - she is more careful together with her claws, however she still likes to bite. I try to maintain whatever helpful for her to gnaw on. If I think she is getting carried away I faucet her nose firmly and say no and put her down. That seems to be working (slowly). Perhaps you must get some of these cat deal with things and make contact with the cat for a treat and pet her a bit. Then just go away and then do it once more in a whilst.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"?"},"dateCreated":"2016-07-21T02:25:08Z","upvoteCount":0},{"@type":"Answer","text":"I don&#39;t think it&#39;s mean.

And you don&#39;t keep him in there all the time so I don&#39;t see how it&#39;s bad.

At seven months however, he should be perfectly capable of being alone. You aren&#39;t being mean at all, don&#39;t worry.\r\nThe only thing I think would help this is to make sure everything available to be ruined and attacked by the kitten is out of the room - and just to leave him at it.

his litter box, a bed, lots of toys and an old couch that he can play on, claw at and sleep on. </p><p>Whenever I&#x27;m home I don&#x27;t put him in his room and let him go outside if he wants. If I don&#x27;t put him in his room he knocks stuff over, chews on stuff he shouldn&#x27;t (like computer/electric cables, hair ties and hair clips) and claws at couches and chairs he shouldn&#x27;t.</p><p>Also at night he goes completely crazy and he attacks pretty much everything he sees, but when I put him in is room he goes to sleep and doesn&#x27;t meow. </p><p>Is this mean to my kitten?</p></div></div><div class="QuestionActionBar__container___14Mqo"><button class="Buttons__primaryBtn___3eT1h Buttons__roundBtnBase___Q8yuU Buttons__btnBase___2Z659 Buttons__withIcon___3aIam" disabled="" aria-disabled="true" aria-label="Answer this question." tabindex="-1"><svg height="24" width="24" style="fill:#ffffff;stroke:#ffffff;stroke-width:0;vertical-align:bottom" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M10.414 18.956c5.992.574 10.588-3.19 10.588-7.537 0-4.09-4.039-7.417-9.004-7.417-4.963 0-9 3.327-9 7.417 0 3.222 2.393 5.487 5.192 6.866 0 0-1.381 2.297-1.492 2.51 1.489-.25 3.352-1.495 3.716-1.839zM11.998 2C18.066 2 23 6.226 23 11.419c0 5.197-5.063 9.987-12.002 9.588-2.264 1.617-4.668 1.882-4.838 1.916-2.019.404-2.43-.905-1.937-1.551.547-.764 1.099-1.68 1.394-2.31C2.709 17.294 1 14.493 1 11.419 1 6.226 5.934 2 11.998 2zM13 11h3a1 1 0 0 1 0 2h-3v3a1 1 0 0 1-2 0v-3H8a1 1 0 0 1 0-2h3V8a1 1 0 0 1 2 0v3z"></path></svg><span>Answer</span></button><button class="Buttons__linkBtn___1gAIw Buttons__btnBase___2Z659 Buttons__withIcon___3aIam" disabled="" aria-disabled="true" aria-label="Save this question." tabindex="-1"><svg class="Cur(p)" width="24" style="fill:#6e7780;stroke:#6e7780;stroke-width:0;vertical-align:bottom" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" data-icon="bookmark"><path d="M6.997 3l.006 3h9.995V3h-10zm5 14.165l5 2.953V8h-10v12.117l5-2.952zm.005 2.508L6.5 22.863c-.667.388-1.5-.096-1.5-.87V2.006C5 1.45 5.448 1 6 1h12.003c.552 0 1 .45 1 1.005v19.988c0 .774-.833 1.258-1.5.87l-5.5-3.19z"></path></svg><span>Save</span></button><span class="QuestionActionBar__pullRight___2Zfk-"><button class="Buttons__linkBtn___1gAIw Buttons__btnBase___2Z659 Buttons__withIcon___3aIam" disabled="" aria-disabled="true" aria-label="Report abuse." tabindex="-1"><svg class="Cur(p)" width="24" style="fill:#6e7780;stroke:#6e7780;stroke-width:0;vertical-align:bottom" height="24" viewBox="0 0 48 48" data-icon="flag"><path d="M40 10H28.62l-2.888-5-.008.004C25.38 4.407 24.74 4 24 4H8c-1.105 0-2 .896-2 2v36c0 1.105.895 2 2 2s2-.895 2-2V28h12.846l2.887 5c.357.62 1.018 1 1.732 1H40c1.105 0 2-.895 2-2V12c0-1.104-.895-2-2-2zm-2 20h-9.38l-2.888-5c-.357-.617-1.018-1-1.732-1H10V8h12.845l2.887 5c.37.642 1.04 1 1.732 1H38v16z"></path></svg></button></span><div id="ans-posting-card-20120621044145AA6BWYm"></div></div></div><div class="QAGroup__fixedQuestionActionBarPortal____IVan"></div><div class="AnswersList__container___27YKM"><div class="AnswersList__listHeader___35PrW"><h3 class="ColoredHeadline__headline___el6Ni">16 Answers</h3><div class="AnswersList__sortBy___1U_Q4"><div class="AnswersList__sortBtn___2r8rh"><span>Relevance</span><svg class="Cur(p)" width="16" style="fill:#26282a;stroke:#26282a;stroke-width:0;vertical-align:bottom" height="16" viewBox="0 0 48 48" data-icon="caret-down"><path d="M24.21 33.173l12.727-12.728c.78-.78.78-2.048 0-2.828-.78-.78-2.047-.78-2.828 0l-9.9 9.9-9.9-9.9c-.78-.78-2.047-.78-2.827 0-.78.78-.78 2.047 0 2.828L24.21 33.173z"></path></svg></div></div></div><div class="AnswersList__listWrap___FBn-u"><ul class="AnswersList__answersList___2ikkB"><li><div class="Answer__answer___FdhNY"><div class="Answer__answerer___ZcKj-"><div class="UserProfile__container___1AkWy"><div class="UserProfile__profileWrapper___2XpWd" style="cursor:pointer"><div class="UserProfile__avatar___2gI-3"><a href="/activity/questions?show=fN7t1HtIaa" aria-label="Visit blah&#x27;s profile page."><img src="https://s.yimg.com/ag/images/default_user_profile_pic_128sq.jpg" alt="blah&#x27;s avatar" aria-hidden="true"/></a></div><div class="UserProfile__userInfo___PiPKv"><a class="UserProfile__userName___1d1RW" href="/activity/questions?show=fN7t1HtIaa">blah</a></div></div><div class="UserProfile__childrenWrapper___2A5yC"><div class="Answer__subtitle___23J6D">9 years ago</div></div></div></div><div class="Answer__bestAnswerBadge___3FtbS"><span>Favourite answer</span></div><div class="ExpandableContent__content___2Iw4v" style="max-height:120px"><p>I don&#x27;t think it is mean, some over the top cat owners may have made you feel that way, after all, you&#x27;re not worried that the cat will harm your stuff, you&#x27;re worried that he might get shocked biting on an electric cable, or swallow a hair clip (-I&#x27;m thinking).

I do not feel i would call her mean yet, however as a substitute unsocialized. We got an eight week kitten (more or less) from the humane society about a month ago and he or she&#x27;s a little bit of a terror. However she&#x27;s studying - she is more careful together with her claws, however she still likes to bite. I try to maintain whatever helpful for her to gnaw on. If I think she is getting carried away I faucet her nose firmly and say no and put her down. That seems to be working (slowly). Perhaps you must get some of these cat deal with things and make contact with the cat for a treat and pet her a bit.

My point is that he can&#x27;t differentiate between old and new.  Does he have plenty of toys outside of his room?  Oftentimes owners give their pets old socks and shoes to play with and chew but the poor little creature doesn&#x27;t know the difference between an old pair of tennis shoes and a new pair of

this mean to my kitten?&quot;,&quot;content&quot;:&quot;My kitten is about 7 months old and whenever I go out or at night when I go to bed I put my kitten in his own room, it&#x27;s about the size of half a big bedroom, so it&#x27;s pretty big for a kitten and it has everything he needs, he has food, water, his litter box, a bed, lots of toys and an old couch that he can play on, claw at and sleep on. \r\nWhenever I&#x27;m home I don&#x27;t put him in his room and let him go outside if he wants. If I don&#x27;t put him in his room he knocks stuff over, chews on stuff he shouldn&#x27;t (like computer/electric cables, hair ties and hair clips) and claws at couches and chairs he shouldn&#x27;t.\r\nAlso at night he goes completely crazy and he attacks pretty much everything he sees, but when I put him in is room he goes to sleep and doesn&#x27;t meow. \r\nIs this mean to my kitten?&quot;,&quot;updatedDetails&quot;:[],&quot;attachedImageUrl&quot;:null,&quot;bestAnswer&quot;:{&quot;qid&quot;:&quot;20120621044145AA6BWYm&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;nWl90bBPx1rZEzu_na4rMJbnRPPxpZQHWEY3vUD8-9G67VBsWoRqmvg=&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;I don&#x27;t think it is mean, some over the top cat owners may have made you feel that way, after all, you&#x27;re not worried that the cat will harm your stuff, you&#x27;re worried that he might get shocked biting on an electric cable, or swallow a hair clip (-I&#x27;m thinking). I think he&#x27;s a very lucky kitty that he has his own room! :)\r\n\r\nBut maybe you should be careful about him clawing at the couch or knocking things down even in his room, because he might think that it&#x27;s the way it is and there are no rules for him to follow, and he might not understand why you get angry when he claws the couch in the living room.&quot;,&quot;attachedImageUrl&quot;:null,&quot;attachedImageId&quot;:null,&quot;reference&quot;:&quot;cat owner&quot;,&quot;answerer&quot;:{&quot;euid&quot;:&quot;6NiWk21.nVazHQjQ8yvGsVGYKqaX.GYHL0C6ntKRgw--&quot;,&quot;kid&quot;:&quot;fN7t1HtIaa&quot;,&quot;nickname&quot;:&quot;blah&quot;,&quot;imageUrl&quot;:&quot;https://s.yimg.com/ag/images/default_user_profile_pic_128sq.jpg&quot;,&quot;level&quot;:3},&quot;isBestAnswer&quot;:true,&quot;thumbsDown&quot;:0,&quot;thumbsUp&quot;:0,&quot;isAnonymous&quot;:false,&quot;commentCount&quot;:0,&quot;createdTime&quot;:&quot;2012-06-21T05:03:16Z&quot;,&quot;userAnswerRelation&quot;:{&quot;hasFlagged&quot;:false,&quot;canFlag&quot;:true,&quot;canVote&quot;:false,&quot;canChooseBestAnswer&quot;:false,&quot;hasVoted&quot;:false,&quot;isAuthor&quot;:false,&quot;hasCommented&quot;:false,&quot;canComment&quot;:true},&quot;bestAnswerAwardTimestamp&quot;:1340772775000},&quot;isLocked&quot;:true,&quot;saveCount&quot;:0,&quot;isAnonymous&quot;:true,&quot;canChooseBestAnswer&quot;:false,&quot;userQuestionRelation&quot;:{&quot;canAnswer&quot;:true,&quot;hasAnswered&quot;:false,&quot;hasFlagged&quot;:false,&quot;hasStarred&quot;:false,&quot;isAuthor&quot;:false},&quot;saveBtnError&quot;:null,&quot;anonymousBtnError&quot;:null,&quot;updateError&quot;:null,&quot;deleteError&quot;:null,&quot;postAnswerError&quot;:null,&quot;reportAbuseError&quot;:null,&quot;setCategoryError&quot;:null,&quot;postQuestionError&quot;:null,&quot;isUpdating&quot;:false,&quot;isUpdateDone&quot;:false,&quot;isChoosingBestAnswer&quot;:false,&quot;isDeleting&quot;:false,&quot;isDeleteDone&quot;:false,&quot;isPostingAnswer&quot;:false,&quot;isPostAnswerDone&quot;:false,&quot;isSettingCategory&quot;:false,&quot;isSetCategoryDone&quot;:false,&quot;isPostingQuestion&quot;:false,&quot;isPostQuestionDone&quot;:false,&quot;categoryAssocSpaceId&quot;:2115317554,&quot;answerCount&quot;:16},&quot;extraQuestions&quot;:{&quot;keys&quot;:[],&quot;byKey&quot;:{}},&quot;questionAnswersList&quot;:{&quot;20120621044145AA6BWYm&quot;:{&quot;qid&quot;:&quot;20120621044145AA6BWYm&quot;,&quot;count&quot;:10,&quot;answerCount&quot;:16,&quot;start&quot;:1,&quot;lang&quot;:&quot;en-GB&quot;,&quot;sortType&quot;:&quot;RELEVANCE&quot;,&quot;answers&quot;:[{&quot;qid&quot;:&quot;20120621044145AA6BWYm&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;TWIMnFNPx1rU9v5ZHEaNcgJG40fhZfmHe5eT6tMhrocXA9F1eIr92jg=&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;3 weeks is relatively rather younger. I do not feel i would call her mean yet, however as a substitute unsocialized. We got an eight week kitten (more or less) from the humane society about a month ago and he or she&#x27;s a little bit of a terror. However she&#x27;s studying - she is more careful together with her claws, however she still likes to bite. I try to maintain whatever helpful for her to gnaw on. If I think she is getting carried away I faucet her nose firmly and say no and put her down. That seems to be working (slowly). Perhaps you must get some of these cat deal with things and make contact with the cat for a treat and pet her a bit. Then just go away and then do it once more in a whilst.&quot;,&quot;attachedImageUrl&quot;:null,&quot;attachedImageId&quot;:null,&quot;reference&quot;:null,&quot;answerer&quot;:{&quot;euid&quot;:&quot;LHJP9I1xlkG3dxpxQh5dDHH9keACqY95bnjkbZVbyA--&quot;,&quot;kid&quot;:&quot;qIkOsd20aa&quot;,&quot;nickname&quot;:&quot;?&quot;,&quot;imageUrl&quot;:&quot;https://s.yimg.com/dh/ap/social/profile/profile_b48.png&quot;,&quot;level&quot;:4},&quot;isBestAnswer&quot;:false,&quot;thumbsDown&quot;:0,&quot;thumbsUp&quot;:0,&quot;isAnonymous&quot;:false,&quot;commentCount&quot;:0,&quot;createdTime&quot;:&quot;2016-07-21T02:25:08Z&quot;,&quot;userAnswerRelation&quot;:{&quot;hasFlagged&quot;:false,&quot;canFlag&quot;:true,&quot;canVote&quot;:false,&quot;canChooseBestAnswer&quot;:false,&quot;hasVoted&quot;:false,&quot;isAuthor&quot;:false,&quot;hasCommented&quot;:false,&quot;canComment&quot;:true}},{&quot;qid&quot;:&quot;20120621044145AA6BWYm&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;E7dO3hBPx1oX5LG8CDWWzjL6H5Ly5ldjMVIBJg1bNrtx2S8BoXm27jI=&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s mean.

You aren&#x27;t being mean at all, don&#x27;t worry.\r\nThe only thing I think would help this is to make sure everything available to be ruined and attacked by the kitten is out of the room - and just to leave him at it. He will eventually realise that his antics don&#x27;t get him his own way.\r\n\r\nGood luck, and I hope everything goes well!&quot;,&quot;attachedImageUrl&quot;:null,&quot;attachedImageId&quot;:null,&quot;reference&quot;:null,&quot;isBestAnswer&quot;:false,&quot;thumbsDown&quot;:0,&quot;thumbsUp&quot;:0,&quot;isAnonymous&quot;:true,&quot;commentCount&quot;:0,&quot;createdTime&quot;:&quot;2012-06-21T04:47:07Z&quot;,&quot;userAnswerRelation&quot;:{&quot;hasFlagged&quot;:false,&quot;canFlag&quot;:true,&quot;canVote&quot;:false,&quot;canChooseBestAnswer&quot;:false,&quot;hasVoted&quot;:false,&quot;isAuthor&quot;:false,&quot;hasCommented&quot;:false,&quot;canComment&quot;:true}},{&quot;qid&quot;:&quot;20120621044145AA6BWYm&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;NQ2OuSJPx1qUDddxFWlfMkAorsnRgS8KCqx5pXTqTyXIBj8HnQfilxw=&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;I dnt think this is cruel..

You mention all sorts of things he chews on that he is not supposed to outside his room.  What about inside his room; does he have many of the same things but \&quot;old, used\&quot; versions?  My point is that he can&#x27;t differentiate between old and new.  Does he have plenty of toys outside of his room?  Oftentimes owners give their pets old socks and shoes to play with and chew but the poor little creature doesn&#x27;t know the difference between an old pair of tennis shoes and a new pair of Pradas.&quot;,&quot;attachedImageUrl&quot;:null,&quot;attachedImageId&quot;:null,&quot;reference&quot;:null,&quot;answerer&quot;:{&quot;euid&quot;:&quot;Fah75r53hkBCB6JBmvxmuW1pqbJ86z4WTrf5KngfyA--&quot;,&quot;kid&quot;:&quot;QTH6DjQlaa&quot;,&quot;nickname&quot;:&quot;the DT&quot;,&quot;imageUrl&quot;:&quot;https://s.yimg.com/ag/images/4516/37356556273_6e36f7_128sq.jpg&quot;,&quot;level&quot;:7},&quot;isBestAnswer&quot;:false,&quot;thumbsDown&quot;:0,&quot;thumbsUp&quot;:0,&quot;isAnonymous&quot;:false,&quot;commentCount&quot;:0,&quot;createdTime&quot;:&quot;2012-06-21T04:52:49Z&quot;,&quot;userAnswerRelation&quot;:{&quot;hasFlagged&quot;:false,&quot;canFlag&quot;:true,&quot;canVote&quot;:false,&quot;canChooseBestAnswer&quot;:false,&quot;hasVoted&quot;:false,&quot;isAuthor&quot;:false,&quot;hasCommented&quot;:false,&quot;canComment&quot;:true}},{&quot;qid&quot;:&quot;20120621044145AA6BWYm&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;9HM5PzJPx1pKaTww3UBbmDU4JZ_NmnKuzcCG_QZFLNNT197CB0o-hoA=&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Putting a kitten in it&#x27;s own room isn&#x27;t mean&quot;,&quot;attachedImageUrl&quot;:null,&quot;attachedImageId&quot;:null,&quot;reference&quot;:null,&quot;isBestAnswer&quot;:false,&quot;thumbsDown&quot;:0,&quot;thumbsUp&quot;:1,&quot;isAnonymous&quot;:true,&quot;commentCount&quot;:0,&quot;createdTime&quot;:&quot;2012-06-21T04:44:36Z&quot;,&quot;userAnswerRelation&quot;:{&quot;hasFlagged&quot;:false,&quot;canFlag&quot;:true,&quot;canVote&quot;:false,&quot;canChooseBestAnswer&quot;:false,&quot;hasVoted&quot;:false,&quot;isAuthor&quot;:false,&quot;hasCommented&quot;:false,&quot;canComment&quot;:true}},{&quot;qid&quot;:&quot;20120621044145AA6BWYm&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;wrr30VxPx1obrLsC_XJJa2mhVHr92Q-jHXg-ZsVG08cjfZdVrelNktY=&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;no you doing the right thing putting him the room at night with all the toys food water a tray . and as he sleeps all night he sound happy there .&quot;,&quot;attachedImageUrl&quot;:null,&quot;attachedImageId&quot;:null,&quot;reference&quot;:null,&quot;answerer&quot;:{&quot;euid&quot;:&quot;.CrxJo96iEwF_X1OT0TejHJgxZyJv0PPCVXbhc.D9Q--&quot;,&quot;kid&quot;:&quot;7a4cOG45aa&quot;,&quot;nickname&quot;:&quot;iceni&quot;,&quot;imageUrl&quot;:&quot;https://s.yimg.com/ag/images/4684/24307849707_5c405a_128sq.jpg&quot;,&quot;level&quot;:4},&quot;isBestAnswer&quot;:false,&quot;thumbsDown&quot;:0,&quot;thumbsUp&quot;:0,&quot;isAnonymous&quot;:false,&quot;commentCount&quot;:0,&quot;createdTime&quot;:&quot;2012-06-21T04:45:02Z&quot;,&quot;userAnswerRelation&quot;:{&quot;hasFlagged&quot;:false,&quot;canFlag&quot;:true,&quot;canVote&quot;:false,&quot;canChooseBestAnswer&quot;:false,&quot;hasVoted&quot;:false,&quot;isAuthor&quot;:false,&quot;hasCommented&quot;:false,&quot;canComment&quot;:true}},{&quot;qid&quot;:&quot;20120621044145AA6BWYm&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;h_jibBNPx1plCnVgSkqmB6N1FbIXcG4FQjOXn9A8TnlIHPg9iQBT9JBAr7R-9SDHT52sQ-yYFada8NUQ51bErcg=&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;This is normal for a kitten and it seems like he likes his room !&quot;,&quot;attachedImageUrl&quot;:null,&quot;attachedImageId&quot;:null,&quot;reference&quot;:null,&quot;answerer&quot;:{&quot;euid&quot;:&quot;RVaEMYlqhlkOpMmG4eyvu4VjA.tEXZvdwL.zEPlzEA--&quot;,&quot;kid&quot;:&quot;6983dd987efb5ed763e7b22625b09401aa&quot;,&quot;nickname&quot;:&quot;Simon C&quot;,&quot;imageUrl&quot;:&quot;https://s.yimg.com/dh/ap/social/profile/profile_b48.png&quot;,&quot;level&quot;:4},&quot;isBestAnswer&quot;:false,&quot;thumbsDown&quot;:0,&quot;thumbsUp&quot;:0,&quot;isAnonymous&quot;:false,&quot;commentCount&quot;:0,&quot;createdTime&quot;:&quot;2012-06-21T04:52:20Z&quot;,&quot;userAnswerRelation&quot;:{&quot;hasFlagged&quot;:false,&quot;canFlag&quot;:true,&quot;canVote&quot;:false,&quot;canChooseBestAnswer&quot;:false,&quot;hasVoted&quot;:false,&quot;isAuthor&quot;:false,&quot;hasCommented&quot;:false,&quot;canComment&quot;:true}},{&quot;qid&quot;:&quot;20120621044145AA6BWYm&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;SxYSPE9Px1pstOSUN05HyMPLIiuvUUwpSKXDvoXlMiZnmE1fEpd0qVc=&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;I think when it rampages at night its just his way of saying he wants to go in his room.
