In fact the seminarian could choose the Eastern Rite Catholic Church and be married. Most accept the discipline of celibacy as a way to be closer to God.\n\n1Corinthians 7:32 But I want you to be free from concern. One who is unmarried is concerned about the things of the Lord, how he may please the Lord;  \n\nMatthew 19:10 The disciples [!] said to Him, &quot;If the relationship of the man with his wife is like this, it is better not to marry.&quot;  \n\nMatthew 19:11 But He said to them, &quot;Not all men can accept this statement, but only those to whom it has been given.  \n\nMatthew 19:12 &quot;For there are eunuchs who were born that way from their mother&#39;s womb; and there are eunuchs who were made eunuchs by men; and there are also eunuchs who made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. He who is able to accept this, let him accept it.&quot;  \n\nRevelation 14:4 These are the ones who have not been defiled with women, for they [fn] have kept themselves chaste. These are the ones who follow the Lamb wherever He goes. These have been purchased from among men as first fruits to God and to the Lamb.  \n\n1Corinthians 7:1 Now concerning the things about which you wrote, it is good for a man not to touch a woman.  \n\n1Corinthians 7:2 But because of immoralities, each man is to have his own wife, and each woman is to have her own husband. \n\n1Corinthians 7:7 Yet I wish that all men were even as I myself am. However, each man has his own gift from God, one in this manner, and another in that.  \n\n1Corinthians 7:8 But I say to the unmarried and to widows that it is good for them if they remain even as I. \n\nPeace be with your spirit\n\n&lt;&lt;&lt;Devout Catholic&gt;&gt;&gt; \nhttp://catholicmyths.blogspot.com/","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"XAndrewX United-Year of Faith"},"dateCreated":"2012-03-27T09:01:44Z","upvoteCount":2},"suggestedAnswer":[{"@type":"Answer","text":"We don&#39;t.  The discipline is only in force for the Latin (or Roman) Rite.  The clergy of the Eastern Churches are allowed to marry.  Also, protestant pastors who convert to Catholicism and were previously married are allowed to remain married.\r\n\r\nThere isn&#39;t anything wrong with celibacy.  Jesus was celibate, so was Paul.  The Church asks its ministers to be celibate to imitate their example.  Also, there is some history behind the reason why this became a practice in the western Church.  \r\n\r\nPriests were allowed to marry, but there was always an emphasis on celibacy.  The issue with a married priesthood in the Church was at the death of the priest, the children would fight over Church property and stewardship.  It also presented the challenge of creating a familial line of clergy, etc.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Colt"},"dateCreated":"2012-03-27T14:45:34Z","upvoteCount":2},{"@type":"Answer","text":"Most of the apostles, pastors, and teachers in the early Church were married.  Peter (who the Catholics claim was the first &quot;pope&quot;) was married.  Paul was celibate, but he mentions other apostles who were married.  This was the norm.\r\n\r\nAlso, you are correct that under the New Covenant every believer is a priest.  Just as the Law Covenant priests were married, the New Covenant priests are married.\r\n\r\nCelibacy is a spiritual gift.  Like other gifts, it is one which not every believer has.

In fact the seminarian could choose the Eastern Rite Catholic Church and be married. Most accept the discipline of celibacy as a way to be closer to God.</p><p></p><p>1Corinthians 7:32 But I want you to be free from concern. One who is unmarried is concerned about the things of the Lord, how he may please the Lord;  </p><p></p><p>Matthew 19:10 The disciples [!] said to Him, &quot;If the relationship of the man with his wife is like this, it is better not to marry.&quot;  </p><p></p><p>Matthew 19:11 But He said to them, &quot;Not all men can accept this statement, but only those to whom it has been given.  </p><p></p><p>Matthew 19:12 &quot;For there are eunuchs who were born that way from their mother&#x27;s womb; and there are eunuchs who were made eunuchs by men; and there are also eunuchs who made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. He who is able to accept this, let him accept it.&quot;  </p><p></p><p>Revelation 14:4 These are the ones who have not been defiled with women, for they [fn] have kept themselves chaste.

Also, protestant pastors who convert to Catholicism and were previously married are allowed to remain married.</p><p></p><p>There isn&#x27;t anything wrong with celibacy.  Jesus was celibate, so was Paul.  The Church asks its ministers to be celibate to imitate their example.  Also, there is some history behind the reason why this became a practice in the western Church.  </p><p></p><p>Priests were allowed to marry, but there was always an emphasis on celibacy.  The issue with a married priesthood in the Church was at the death of the priest, the children would fight over Church property and stewardship.

does the Catholic church forbid one from becoming a \&quot;priest\&quot; without a vow of celibacy--since this is true?&quot;,&quot;content&quot;:&quot;\&quot;Priest\&quot; is a term reserved for the old testament... Jesus (Hebrews 4:14-15)... and all Christians, eternally (1 Peter 2:9)\r\n\r\nToday, God gives us apostles, prophets, evangelists, pastors, and teachers (Ephesians 4:11) -- all of whom have been called to a \&quot;royal priesthood\&quot; (1 Peter 2:9).\r\n\r\nForbidding people to marry is a demonic practice (1 Tim 4:3), and celibacy is a unique calling for believers of all kinds, between the individual and God--not for any special position within the church and not for people who are \&quot;priests\&quot; (Matthew 19:12).\r\n\r\nFurthermore, even Paul (by God) encouraged people who were single to remain single if possible, but did not forbid it to anyone (1 Corinthians 7:8-9)\r\n\r\n--------\r\n\r\nConsidering all of this... why does the Catholic Church forbid people from becoming \&quot;priests\&quot; unless they take a \&quot;vow\&quot; of celibacy?  Accordingly, why does the Catholic Church forbid marriage for priests?&quot;,&quot;updatedDetails&quot;:[],&quot;attachedImageUrl&quot;:null,&quot;bestAnswer&quot;:{&quot;qid&quot;:&quot;20120327073246AAJSoJc&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;wo751etPx1rJnqyBX7RoTqB_dyynIywmTLOWojxg10FvwU343cBjRa4=&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;It is a Discipline.....why are you trying to make it seem Priests are forced?\n\nPriests willing take the vow, which the bible supports. In fact the seminarian could choose the Eastern Rite Catholic Church and be married. Most accept the discipline of celibacy as a way to be closer to God.\n\n1Corinthians 7:32 But I want you to be free from concern. One who is unmarried is concerned about the things of the Lord, how he may please the Lord;  \n\nMatthew 19:10 The disciples [!] said to Him, \&quot;If the relationship of the man with his wife is like this, it is better not to marry.\&quot;  \n\nMatthew 19:11 But He said to them, \&quot;Not all men can accept this statement, but only those to whom it has been given.  \n\nMatthew 19:12 \&quot;For there are eunuchs who were born that way from their mother&#x27;s womb; and there are eunuchs who were made eunuchs by men; and there are also eunuchs who made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. He who is able to accept this, let him accept it.\&quot;  \n\nRevelation 14:4 These are the ones who have not been defiled with women, for they [fn] have kept themselves chaste. These are the ones who follow the Lamb wherever He goes. These have been purchased from among men as first fruits to God and to the Lamb.  \n\n1Corinthians 7:1 Now concerning the things about which you wrote, it is good for a man not to touch a woman.  \n\n1Corinthians 7:2 But because of immoralities, each man is to have his own wife, and each woman is to have her own husband. \n\n1Corinthians 7:7 Yet I wish that all men were even as I myself am. However, each man has his own gift from God, one in this manner, and another in that.  \n\n1Corinthians 7:8 But I say to the unmarried and to widows that it is good for them if they remain even as I. \n\nPeace be with your spirit\n\n&lt;&lt;&lt;Devout Catholic&gt;&gt;&gt; \nhttp://catholicmyths.blogspot.com/&quot;,&quot;attachedImageUrl&quot;:null,&quot;attachedImageId&quot;:null,&quot;reference&quot;:null,&quot;answerer&quot;:{&quot;euid&quot;:&quot;VHiybQ5zhEUdsa4H1xZrty.MZx.d7OXjwjki_9KLvQ--&quot;,&quot;kid&quot;:&quot;jCa8lEHMaa&quot;,&quot;nickname&quot;:&quot;XAndrewX United-Year of Faith&quot;,&quot;imageUrl&quot;:&quot;https://s.yimg.com/ag/images/4647/38336229185_9ee141_128sq.jpg&quot;,&quot;level&quot;:6},&quot;isBestAnswer&quot;:true,&quot;thumbsDown&quot;:4,&quot;thumbsUp&quot;:2,&quot;isAnonymous&quot;:false,&quot;commentCount&quot;:0,&quot;createdTime&quot;:&quot;2012-03-27T09:01:44Z&quot;,&quot;userAnswerRelation&quot;:{&quot;hasFlagged&quot;:false,&quot;canFlag&quot;:true,&quot;canVote&quot;:false,&quot;canChooseBestAnswer&quot;:false,&quot;hasVoted&quot;:false,&quot;isAuthor&quot;:false,&quot;hasCommented&quot;:false,&quot;canComment&quot;:true},&quot;bestAnswerAwardTimestamp&quot;:1332859106000,&quot;bestAnswerRating&quot;:3},&quot;isLocked&quot;:true,&quot;saveCount&quot;:0,&quot;isAnonymous&quot;:false,&quot;canChooseBestAnswer&quot;:false,&quot;userQuestionRelation&quot;:{&quot;canAnswer&quot;:true,&quot;hasAnswered&quot;:false,&quot;hasFlagged&quot;:false,&quot;hasStarred&quot;:false,&quot;isAuthor&quot;:false},&quot;saveBtnError&quot;:null,&quot;anonymousBtnError&quot;:null,&quot;updateError&quot;:null,&quot;deleteError&quot;:null,&quot;postAnswerError&quot;:null,&quot;reportAbuseError&quot;:null,&quot;setCategoryError&quot;:null,&quot;postQuestionError&quot;:null,&quot;isUpdating&quot;:false,&quot;isUpdateDone&quot;:false,&quot;isChoosingBestAnswer&quot;:false,&quot;isDeleting&quot;:false,&quot;isDeleteDone&quot;:false,&quot;isPostingAnswer&quot;:false,&quot;isPostAnswerDone&quot;:false,&quot;isSettingCategory&quot;:false,&quot;isSetCategoryDone&quot;:false,&quot;isPostingQuestion&quot;:false,&quot;isPostQuestionDone&quot;:false,&quot;categoryAssocSpaceId&quot;:2115300573,&quot;answerCount&quot;:7},&quot;extraQuestions&quot;:{&quot;keys&quot;:[],&quot;byKey&quot;:{}},&quot;questionAnswersList&quot;:{&quot;20120327073246AAJSoJc&quot;:{&quot;qid&quot;:&quot;20120327073246AAJSoJc&quot;,&quot;count&quot;:7,&quot;answerCount&quot;:7,&quot;start&quot;:1,&quot;lang&quot;:&quot;en-US&quot;,&quot;sortType&quot;:&quot;RELEVANCE&quot;,&quot;answers&quot;:[{&quot;qid&quot;:&quot;20120327073246AAJSoJc&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;30H-T_NPx1oAy9y3CAnXghC2BEK3HtKHFz6AYa29Cs078RSW98mm7VI=&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;We don&#x27;t.  The discipline is only in force for the Latin (or Roman) Rite.  The clergy of the Eastern Churches are allowed to marry.  Also, protestant pastors who convert to Catholicism and were previously married are allowed to remain married.\r\n\r\nThere isn&#x27;t anything wrong with celibacy.  Jesus was celibate, so was Paul.  The Church asks its ministers to be celibate to imitate their example.  Also, there is some history behind the reason why this became a practice in the western Church.  \r\n\r\nPriests were allowed to marry, but there was always an emphasis on celibacy.  The issue with a married priesthood in the Church was at the death of the priest, the children would fight over Church property and stewardship.  It also presented the challenge of creating a familial line of clergy, etc.&quot;,&quot;attachedImageUrl&quot;:null,&quot;attachedImageId&quot;:null,&quot;reference&quot;:&quot;Catholic Christian&quot;,&quot;answerer&quot;:{&quot;euid&quot;:&quot;K7AEza51nUUukPIOXwfUxFrJ.EXCSxZSd7z2ouG3xg--&quot;,&quot;kid&quot;:&quot;4m2xNTSUaa&quot;,&quot;nickname&quot;:&quot;Colt&quot;,&quot;imageUrl&quot;:&quot;https://s.yimg.com/ag/images/default_user_profile_pic_128sq.jpg&quot;,&quot;level&quot;:4},&quot;isBestAnswer&quot;:false,&quot;thumbsDown&quot;:2,&quot;thumbsUp&quot;:2,&quot;isAnonymous&quot;:false,&quot;commentCount&quot;:0,&quot;createdTime&quot;:&quot;2012-03-27T14:45:34Z&quot;,&quot;userAnswerRelation&quot;:{&quot;hasFlagged&quot;:false,&quot;canFlag&quot;:true,&quot;canVote&quot;:false,&quot;canChooseBestAnswer&quot;:false,&quot;hasVoted&quot;:false,&quot;isAuthor&quot;:false,&quot;hasCommented&quot;:false,&quot;canComment&quot;:true}},{&quot;qid&quot;:&quot;20120327073246AAJSoJc&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;jCEN18lPx1r6AIaTQPxbREJpCbHCYbbQMnQDrA2-3mnJhRoyIX_ef2k=&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Most of the apostles, pastors, and teachers in the early Church were married.

Just as the Law Covenant priests were married, the New Covenant priests are married.\r\n\r\nCelibacy is a spiritual gift.  Like other gifts, it is one which not every believer has.
