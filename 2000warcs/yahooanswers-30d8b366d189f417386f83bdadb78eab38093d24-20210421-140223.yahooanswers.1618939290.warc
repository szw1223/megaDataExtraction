I had a tb gelding who was similar, most of the time he tied fine but every so often if he startled at something, as soon as he felt pressure on his poll he would completely freak out and thrash around till something broke. He was always tied to string but he usually broke his lead rope. He was always tied to a single point as I&#39;m in England and most yards don&#39;t have cross ties. The way we dealt with this was that he was never left alone tied up which made the next bit possible. Instead of tying the rope to the string we made a knot right at the end of the rope and put it through the string so there was loads hanging down with not much going from the string to the horse. Don&#39;t tie it, just leave it through. This meant that anytime he pulled back a bit the rope slid through the string a bit so he didn&#39;t get the tightening at the poll which is what freaked him out. You have to keep an eye on it and every time it starts to get a bit long pull it back through to shorten it again. By having the knot in the end that will stop the rope just flying through loosely but is nice and easy to release. Also try cutting half way through the string so it breaks more easily as it sounds like she reacts in a similar way. \r\nI also try to make sure they have a hay net when tied if possible although they should tie without a net for situations when you can&#39;t have a net there such as farrier or something like that.\r\n\r\nTry to tie to a slightly higher ring than normal as they can do quite a lot of damage to their poll pulling like that but if the ring is higher there is less risk. I would also have a chiropractor or back person check her over to make sure she hasn&#39;t hurt her poll pulling like she did.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"MyNutmeg"},"dateCreated":"2010-10-05T15:19:09Z","upvoteCount":1},"suggestedAnswer":[{"@type":"Answer","text":"So, you are unclear on this, has she been OK for the last 2.5 years and this is a new behavior?  She is not having a flashback all of a sudden.  Something happened to provoke this.  That said, now that you know she could do this DO NOT tie her anymore.  The next time, the both of you might not be so lucky.  You are extremely fortunate she did not flip over on you.  Another thing is to not tie her lead rope to the  post or whatever you are using.  Tie the rope with a small piece of breakable string or twine so that if she freaks, she can get free to prevent a devastating wreck.\r\n\r\nTrain her to stand ground tied.   Personally, I do not cross tie my horses. I  don&#39;t believe in it.  I have them all trained to ground tie or tie by the lead if I am somewhere it has to be done, like a clinic or when I would have to use the tie on the side of my trailer.  I never tie my horses at home as it is not necessary.   Find out what the problem is and help her.  Please be careful.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Barefoottrimmer"},"dateCreated":"2010-10-05T15:06:43Z","upvoteCount":0},{"@type":"Answer","text":"I have an idea to help her learn how to tie without actually being tied but its going to take two people for this exersize. Take her lead, and pull it through the loop (whatever you use to tie her with) and stand next to her. When she backs up and or rears or starts throwing a fit lead her in a circle and make her stand their again. Your going to use the second person to grab her and circle her when you get far enough away when she gets nervouse. Repeat everytime she moves. DO NOT tie her until you can completley move away from her for 5-10 minutes at a time. Your not actually tieing her so their won&#39;t be a risk of injury is she escapes. But that second person can get ahold of her and turn her into a circle. She has to learn that she needs to stand until you tell her otherwise. This takes a lot of work and consistancy but she will eventually get the hint that if she just stand their she won&#39;t have to work. Horses just hate small circles. This will also teach her to ground tie when you need her too. I&#39;ve had to do this with my 17 H TB gelding that would do the same thing. Good luck hun and I&#39;m glad she didn&#39;t get hurt!  OH I love ireland! My family is irish and came from there in 1923 :) Good luck","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Teeny"},"dateCreated":"2010-10-05T17:02:29Z","upvoteCount":0},{"@type":"Answer","text":"My arab cross would do this out of the blue for no reason whatsoever, until she learned that the rope would give no matter what, and then she was fine. I&#39;ve always tied to twine, but have noticed that blue twine doesn&#39;t give like the other types. The twine is color coded by its strength, so if you tie to twine make sure you have the weaker yellow or orange type. Even better, is twine that is older and left out in the sun for a week or so so that it is really weak.\r\n\r\nAnd of course, keep a pocket knife ready when you tie her. I wouldn&#39;t just loop the rope through without tying it though- I have met one too many a horse that is too smart for that trick, but a quick knife job would work if your twine doesn&#39;t break or the knot is pulled too tight.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Cassie"},"dateCreated":"2010-10-05T15:58:45Z","upvoteCount":0},{"@type":"Answer","text":"When a mate cheats this can be a very tramatic factor...It will also be debilitating to the devoted mate...I&#39;d definately see a therapist and notice if you happen to are not able to &quot;repair&quot; what&#39;s going on inside your self...When you&#39;ll be able to triumph over the shaddow of the unjust acts performed towards you and now not task that &quot;worry&quot; onto a brand new character...then you understand you&#39;ve got been equipped to come back to phrases with the &quot;believe problems&quot; that increase while your harm that method.

Is it possible?</h1><div class="Question__contentWrapper___lkV5T"><div class="ExpandableContent__content___2Iw4v" style="max-height:120px"><p>The reason why I&#x27;m asking this is I&#x27;ve started to notice a trend in my mare when it comes to tieing up.</p><p>It is like something snaps in the horse, she&#x27;s an absolute saint on the ground, you can do anything to her, but it&#x27;s like once she gets tied up she changes.</p><p></p><p>We had a little episode today when I went to hot towel her as we are going showjumping tomorrow, I had her tied up in the barn aisle - not in cross ties, but on a bit of twine. Another girl was clipping in the stables accross from me but I know this was not the reason for my mares freak out as the clippers had been going for a good half hour, plus she&#x27;s an old hand at the clippers. So I had her tied, she seemed grand, and I got the towel with warm water (it wasn&#x27;t too hot) and started to hot towel her.</p><p></p><p>Once her whole shoulder was done, she suddenly freaked, and pulled with all her might on the leadrope, which unfortunatly didn&#x27;t give. She then reared up and started to thrash, I was trying to get her untied but the quick release knot was pulled way too tight and wouldn&#x27;t give,(At this moment it&#x27;s still there, no one can untie it now) so I tried to undo the headcollar, but as she had her entire weight pulling away from it, it was near impossible. She broke the leadrope at the buckle, thank heavens (which almost broke my finger :D) and happilly trotted back to her stable. She was covered in blood from this episode which was a result from her thrashing, luckily it wasn&#x27;t too deep. She is walking fine and was calmly eating her hay not 2 minutes after this eposide.</p><p></p><p>She had an episode like this last summer &#x27;09, where the exact same happened, including breaking the leadrope (it amazes me how she is actually strong enough to this this), I was trying to hose her down after a long showjumping session at the time, she hoses fine normally.</p><p></p><p>I should note that she will lead with a headcollar and leadrope brilliantly, we go for walks all the time, and she will allow you to hose her and hot towel when you&#x27;re holding the lead rope, it&#x27;s just once she&#x27;s tied she changes. I do not tie her up when grooming as I want grooming to be peaceful and calm, she will tie in a stable if necissary, but will gradually get more irritated.</p><p></p><p>So I wonder if it&#x27;s possible that she had a bad experience when tied up as a youngster, before I had her? It would make sense how such a calm horse will change once she&#x27;s tied up ... even when her best friend is right beside her she just cannot relax. The crazed look in her eyes showed that she was terrified of the situation.</p><p></p><p>She is a 15.1hh arabian mare, she&#x27;s 9 years old, I&#x27;ve had her 2 and a half years. She was only broken at 7, and her past is questionable, I cannot find any details on her before I bought her and broke her.</p></div><div class="QAContent__updatedDetailWrapper___NCwEi"><span class="QAContent__updatedDetailTitle___3ecfj">Update<!-- -->:</span><br/><div class="ExpandableContent__content___2Iw4v" style="max-height:120px"><p>The leadrope was tied to a bit of twine, the leadrope gave before the twing did however.</p><p></p><p>I rarely tie her, I suppose stress of having to get loads of horses ready made me relapse in my judgement with tieing her, rest assured I never normally tie her when I can help it, I do not want a much worse accident to occur. </p><p></p><p>I think in the whole 2 and a half years she has only been tied a few times, she&#x27;s quiet on the ground, so there was rarely any need to do it. I should note she will tie if I stand next to her all the time, she gets nervous if I were to walk away, on this occassion however, I had turned around to soak the rag I was using to how towel ....</p></div></div><div class="QAContent__updatedDetailWrapper___NCwEi"><span class="QAContent__updatedDetailTitle___3ecfj">Update 2<!-- -->:</span><br/><div class="ExpandableContent__content___2Iw4v" style="max-height:120px"><p>Ground tieing would be a good idea - but in a country where english riding is the norm I would say it&#x27;s not a practice I have ever witnessed personally. </p><p>I am from Ireland, so western riding and training is never explored here, we don&#x27;t get clinics and such, and natural horsemanship is pretty much sneered at ... sad really ...</p></div></div><div class="QAContent__updatedDetailWrapper___NCwEi"><span class="QAContent__updatedDetailTitle___3ecfj">Update 3<!-- -->:</span><br/><div class="ExpandableContent__content___2Iw4v" style="max-height:120px"><p>Louise that is a great idea, It&#x27;s comforting to know that someone else had the same problem. I don&#x27;t leave her when she&#x27;s tied, she doesn&#x27;t like being on her own, so I wouldn&#x27;t take her out, tie her and then dissappear, I even avoid going to the tack room and leaving her to get grooming supplies, I just have everything ready. I will try that with just looping the leadrope through the twine, not tieing it, may give both myself and herself reassurance that no one will get hurt. I&#x27;m in Ireland myself, cross ties are quite common here!</p></div></div></div><div class="QuestionActionBar__container___14Mqo"><button class="Buttons__primaryBtn___3eT1h Buttons__roundBtnBase___Q8yuU Buttons__btnBase___2Z659 Buttons__withIcon___3aIam" disabled="" aria-disabled="true" aria-label="Answer this question." tabindex="-1"><svg height="24" width="24" style="fill:#ffffff;stroke:#ffffff;stroke-width:0;vertical-align:bottom" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M10.414 18.956c5.992.574 10.588-3.19 10.588-7.537 0-4.09-4.039-7.417-9.004-7.417-4.963 0-9 3.327-9 7.417 0 3.222 2.393 5.487 5.192 6.866 0 0-1.381 2.297-1.492 2.51 1.489-.25 3.352-1.495 3.716-1.839zM11.998 2C18.066 2 23 6.226 23 11.419c0 5.197-5.063 9.987-12.002 9.588-2.264 1.617-4.668 1.882-4.838 1.916-2.019.404-2.43-.905-1.937-1.551.547-.764 1.099-1.68 1.394-2.31C2.709 17.294 1 14.493 1 11.419 1 6.226 5.934 2 11.998 2zM13 11h3a1 1 0 0 1 0 2h-3v3a1 1 0 0 1-2 0v-3H8a1 1 0 0 1 0-2h3V8a1 1 0 0 1 2 0v3z"></path></svg><span>Answer</span></button><button class="Buttons__linkBtn___1gAIw Buttons__btnBase___2Z659 Buttons__withIcon___3aIam" disabled="" aria-disabled="true" aria-label="Save this question." tabindex="-1"><svg class="Cur(p)" width="24" style="fill:#6e7780;stroke:#6e7780;stroke-width:0;vertical-align:bottom" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" data-icon="bookmark"><path d="M6.997 3l.006 3h9.995V3h-10zm5 14.165l5 2.953V8h-10v12.117l5-2.952zm.005 2.508L6.5 22.863c-.667.388-1.5-.096-1.5-.87V2.006C5 1.45 5.448 1 6 1h12.003c.552 0 1 .45 1 1.005v19.988c0 .774-.833 1.258-1.5.87l-5.5-3.19z"></path></svg><span>Save</span></button><span class="QuestionActionBar__pullRight___2Zfk-"><button class="Buttons__linkBtn___1gAIw Buttons__btnBase___2Z659 Buttons__withIcon___3aIam" disabled="" aria-disabled="true" aria-label="Report abuse." tabindex="-1"><svg class="Cur(p)" width="24" style="fill:#6e7780;stroke:#6e7780;stroke-width:0;vertical-align:bottom" height="24" viewBox="0 0 48 48" data-icon="flag"><path d="M40 10H28.62l-2.888-5-.008.004C25.38 4.407 24.74 4 24 4H8c-1.105 0-2 .896-2 2v36c0 1.105.895 2 2 2s2-.895 2-2V28h12.846l2.887 5c.357.62 1.018 1 1.732 1H40c1.105 0 2-.895 2-2V12c0-1.104-.895-2-2-2zm-2 20h-9.38l-2.888-5c-.357-.617-1.018-1-1.732-1H10V8h12.845l2.887 5c.37.642 1.04 1 1.732 1H38v16z"></path></svg></button></span><div id="ans-posting-card-20101005145916AAfR2HS"></div></div></div><div class="QAGroup__fixedQuestionActionBarPortal____IVan"></div><div class="AnswersList__container___27YKM"><div class="AnswersList__listHeader___35PrW"><h3 class="ColoredHeadline__headline___el6Ni">6 Answers</h3><div class="AnswersList__sortBy___1U_Q4"><div class="AnswersList__sortBtn___2r8rh"><span>Relevance</span><svg class="Cur(p)" width="16" style="fill:#26282a;stroke:#26282a;stroke-width:0;vertical-align:bottom" height="16" viewBox="0 0 48 48" data-icon="caret-down"><path d="M24.21 33.173l12.727-12.728c.78-.78.78-2.048 0-2.828-.78-.78-2.047-.78-2.828 0l-9.9 9.9-9.9-9.9c-.78-.78-2.047-.78-2.827 0-.78.78-.78 2.047 0 2.828L24.21 33.173z"></path></svg></div></div></div><div class="AnswersList__listWrap___FBn-u"><ul class="AnswersList__answersList___2ikkB"><li><div class="Answer__answer___FdhNY"><div class="Answer__answerer___ZcKj-"><div class="UserProfile__container___1AkWy"><div class="UserProfile__profileWrapper___2XpWd" style="cursor:pointer"><div class="UserProfile__avatar___2gI-3"><a href="/activity/questions?show=36612d416e7176f5335f2b3fb47cf46caa" aria-label="Visit MyNutmeg&#x27;s profile page."><img src="https://s.yimg.com/ag/images/4598/39136182912_8857d8_128sq.jpg" alt="MyNutmeg&#x27;s avatar" aria-hidden="true"/></a></div><div class="UserProfile__userInfo___PiPKv"><a class="UserProfile__userName___1d1RW" href="/activity/questions?show=36612d416e7176f5335f2b3fb47cf46caa">MyNutmeg</a><div class="LevelBadge__levelBadge___2GjGv"><span>Lv <!-- -->6</span></div></div></div><div class="UserProfile__childrenWrapper___2A5yC"><div class="Answer__subtitle___23J6D">1 decade ago</div></div></div></div><div class="Answer__bestAnswerBadge___3FtbS"><span>Favorite Answer</span></div><div class="ExpandableContent__content___2Iw4v" style="max-height:120px"><p>I would go with she&#x27;s had some sort of incident which has freaked her. I had a tb gelding who was similar, most of the time he tied fine but every so often if he startled at something, as soon as he felt pressure on his poll he would completely freak out and thrash around till something broke. He was always tied to string but he usually broke his lead rope. He was always tied to a single point as I&#x27;m in England and most yards don&#x27;t have cross ties. The way we dealt with this was that he was never left alone tied up which made the next bit possible. Instead of tying the rope to the string we made a knot right at the end of the rope and put it through the string so there was loads hanging down with not much going from the string to the horse. Don&#x27;t tie it, just leave it through. This meant that anytime he pulled back a bit the rope slid through the string a bit so he didn&#x27;t get the tightening at the poll which is what freaked him out. You have to keep an eye on it and every time it starts to get a bit long pull it back through to shorten it again. By having the knot in the end that will stop the rope just flying through loosely but is nice and easy to release. Also try cutting half way through the string so it breaks more easily as it sounds like she reacts in a similar way. </p><p>I also try to make sure they have a hay net when tied if possible although they should tie without a net for situations when you can&#x27;t have a net there such as farrier or something like that.</p><p></p><p>Try to tie to a slightly higher ring than normal as they can do quite a lot of damage to their poll pulling like that but if the ring is higher there is less risk. I would also have a chiropractor or back person check her over to make sure she hasn&#x27;t hurt her poll pulling like she did.</p></div><div class="AnswerActionBar__answerActionBarWrap___bd9es"><div class="AnswerActionBar__answerActionBar___1LrM2"><div class="AnswerActionBar__left___5SkAf"><button class="Buttons__linkBtn___1gAIw Buttons__btnBase___2Z659 Buttons__withIcon___3aIam" disabled="" aria-disabled="true" aria-label="Thumbs up for this answer." tabindex="-1"><svg class="Cur(p)" width="24" style="fill:#6e7780;stroke:#6e7780;stroke-width:0;vertical-align:bottom" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" data-icon="thumb-up"><path d="M23 10.9c0-1.6-1.6-2.6-3.2-2.6h-4.5c.4-1.1.5-2.5.3-4.1-.2-1.7-1.3-2.9-2.7-3.1-1.5-.2-2.8.6-2.8 2.1.1 1.3-.4 2.2-1.5 3.5-.1 0-.2.2-.4.3-.5.6-1.2 1.2-1.8 1.7l-.5.5H2.1c-.6 0-1.1.4-1.1 1V22c0 .5.5 1 1.1 1h4.2c.6 0 1.1-.4 1.1-1h10.8c1.4 0 2.7-.9 2.7-2.5 0-.4-.1-.8-.2-1.1.6-.4 1-1 1-1.7 0-.4-.1-.8-.3-1.1.6-.4 1-1 1-1.8 0-.4-.1-.8-.2-1.1.4-.5.8-1.1.8-1.8zm-2.7 2.6zM5.2 21H3.1v-9.9h2.1V21zm13-1H7.4v-9.4c.2-.1.3-.3.5-.4.6-.6 1.3-1.2 1.9-1.9.2-.1.3-.3.5-.5 1.4-1.6 2-3 2-4.8 0 0 0-.1.3 0 .5.1.9.5 1 1.4.3 2.1-.2 3.7-.6 4.1-.8.6-.3 1.7.7 1.7h6.2c.6 0 1.1.4 1.1.7s-.5.7-.6.7c-1.4 0-1.4 1.8-.1 2 0 .1.1.2.1.3s0 .2-.2.2c-.2.1-.4.1-.6.1-1.2 0-1.5 1.5-.4 1.9l.2.2c.2.1.2.3.2.5 0 .1-.1.1-.3.2-.2.1-.4.2-.6.2-1.1.1-1.2 1.6-.1 1.9l.1.1s.2.2.2.4c-.2.3-.4.4-.7.4z"></path></svg><span>1</span></button><button class="Buttons__linkBtn___1gAIw Buttons__btnBase___2Z659 Buttons__withIcon___3aIam" disabled="" aria-disabled="true" aria-label="Thumbs down for this answer." tabindex="-1"><svg class="Cur(p)" width="24" style="fill:#6e7780;stroke:#6e7780;stroke-width:0;vertical-align:bottom" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" data-icon="thumb-down"><path d="M1 13.1c0 1.6 1.6 2.6 3.2 2.6h4.5c-.4 1.1-.5 2.5-.3 4.1.2 1.7 1.3 2.9 2.7 3.1 1.5.2 2.8-.6 2.8-2.1-.1-1.3.4-2.2 1.5-3.5.1-.2.3-.3.4-.5.6-.6 1.2-1.2 1.8-1.7.2-.2.4-.3.6-.5H22c.6 0 1.1-.4 1.1-1V2c0-.5-.5-1-1.1-1h-4.2c-.6 0-1.1.4-1.1 1H5.9c-1.4 0-2.7.9-2.7 2.5 0 .4.1.8.2 1.1-.6.4-1 1-1 1.7 0 .4.1.8.3 1.1-.6.4-1 1-1 1.8 0 .4.1.8.2 1.1-.5.5-.9 1.1-.9 1.8zm2.7-2.6zM18.8 3h2.1v9.9h-2.1V3zm-13 1H16.6v9.4c-.2.1-.3.3-.5.4-.7.6-1.3 1.2-1.9 1.8l-.5.5c-1.4 1.6-2 3-2 4.8 0 0 0 .1-.3 0-.5-.1-.9-.5-1-1.4-.3-2.1.2-3.7.6-4.1.8-.6.3-1.7-.7-1.7H4.2c-.6 0-1.1-.4-1.1-.7s.5-.7.6-.7c1.4 0 1.4-1.8.1-2 0-.1-.1-.2-.1-.3s0-.2.2-.2c.2-.1.4-.1.6-.1 1.2.2 1.6-1.3.5-1.7l-.2-.2c-.2-.1-.3-.3-.3-.5 0-.1.1-.1.3-.2.2-.1.5-.2.6-.2 1.1-.1 1.2-1.6.1-1.9l-.1-.1s-.1-.2-.1-.4c0-.4.2-.5.5-.5z"></path></svg><span>0</span></button></div><div class="AnswerActionBar__right___nWVBY"><button class="Buttons__linkBtn___1gAIw Buttons__btnBase___2Z659 Buttons__withIcon___3aIam" disabled="" aria-disabled="true" aria-label="Report abuse." tabindex="-1"><svg class="Cur(p)" width="24" style="fill:#6e7780;stroke:#6e7780;stroke-width:0;vertical-align:bottom" height="24" viewBox="0 0 48 48" data-icon="flag"><path d="M40 10H28.62l-2.888-5-.008.004C25.38 4.407 24.74 4 24 4H8c-1.105 0-2 .896-2 2v36c0 1.105.895 2 2 2s2-.895 2-2V28h12.846l2.887 5c.357.62 1.018 1 1.732 1H40c1.105 0 2-.895 2-2V12c0-1.104-.895-2-2-2zm-2 20h-9.38l-2.888-5c-.357-.617-1.018-1-1.732-1H10V8h12.845l2.887 5c.37.642 1.04 1 1.732 1H38v16z"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></li><li><div class="Answer__answer___FdhNY"><div class="Answer__answerer___ZcKj-"><div class="UserProfile__container___1AkWy"><div class="UserProfile__profileWrapper___2XpWd" style="cursor:pointer"><div class="UserProfile__avatar___2gI-3"><a href="/activity/questions?show=EQvAbyvcaa" aria-label="Visit Barefoottrimmer&#x27;s profile page."><img src="https://s.yimg.com/dh/ap/social/profile/profile_b48.png" alt="Barefoottrimmer&#x27;s avatar" aria-hidden="true"/></a></div><div class="UserProfile__userInfo___PiPKv"><a class="UserProfile__userName___1d1RW" href="/activity/questions?show=EQvAbyvcaa">Barefoottrimmer</a><div class="LevelBadge__levelBadge___2GjGv"><span>Lv <!-- -->7</span></div></div></div><div class="UserProfile__childrenWrapper___2A5yC"><div class="Answer__subtitle___23J6D">1 decade ago</div></div></div></div><div class="ExpandableContent__content___2Iw4v" style="max-height:120px"><p>So, you are unclear on this, has she been OK for the last 2.5 years and this is a new behavior?  She is not having a flashback all of a sudden.  Something happened to provoke this.  That said, now that you know she could do this DO NOT tie her anymore.  The next time, the both of you might not be so lucky.  You are extremely fortunate she did not flip over on you.  Another thing is to not tie her lead rope to the  post or whatever you are using.  Tie the rope with a small piece of breakable string or twine so that if she freaks, she can get free to prevent a devastating wreck.</p><p></p><p>Train her to stand ground tied.   Personally, I do not cross tie my horses. I  don&#x27;t believe in it.  I have them all trained to ground tie or tie by the lead if I am somewhere it has to be done, like a clinic or when I would have to use the tie on the side of my trailer.  I never tie my horses at home as it is not necessary.   Find out what the problem is and help her.

Take her lead, and pull it through the loop (whatever you use to tie her with) and stand next to her. When she backs up and or rears or starts throwing a fit lead her in a circle and make her stand their again. Your going to use the second person to grab her and circle her when you get far enough away when she gets nervouse. Repeat everytime she moves. DO NOT tie her until you can completley move away from her for 5-10 minutes at a time. Your not actually tieing her so their won&#x27;t be a risk of injury is she escapes. But that second person can get ahold of her and turn her into a circle. She has to learn that she needs to stand until you tell her otherwise. This takes a lot of work and consistancy but she will eventually get the hint that if she just stand their she won&#x27;t have to work. Horses just hate small circles. This will also teach her to ground tie when you need her too. I&#x27;ve had to do this with my 17 H TB gelding that would do the same thing. Good luck hun and I&#x27;m glad she didn&#x27;t get hurt!  OH I love ireland! My family is irish and came from there in 1923 :) Good luck</p></div><div class="AnswerActionBar__answerActionBarWrap___bd9es"><div class="AnswerActionBar__answerActionBar___1LrM2"><div class="AnswerActionBar__left___5SkAf"><button class="Buttons__linkBtn___1gAIw Buttons__btnBase___2Z659 Buttons__withIcon___3aIam" disabled="" aria-disabled="true" aria-label="Thumbs up for this answer." tabindex="-1"><svg class="Cur(p)" width="24" style="fill:#6e7780;stroke:#6e7780;stroke-width:0;vertical-align:bottom" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" data-icon="thumb-up"><path d="M23 10.9c0-1.6-1.6-2.6-3.2-2.6h-4.5c.4-1.1.5-2.5.3-4.1-.2-1.7-1.3-2.9-2.7-3.1-1.5-.2-2.8.6-2.8 2.1.1 1.3-.4 2.2-1.5 3.5-.1 0-.2.2-.4.3-.5.6-1.2 1.2-1.8 1.7l-.5.5H2.1c-.6 0-1.1.4-1.1 1V22c0 .5.5 1 1.1 1h4.2c.6 0 1.1-.4 1.1-1h10.8c1.4 0 2.7-.9 2.7-2.5 0-.4-.1-.8-.2-1.1.6-.4 1-1 1-1.7 0-.4-.1-.8-.3-1.1.6-.4 1-1 1-1.8 0-.4-.1-.8-.2-1.1.4-.5.8-1.1.8-1.8zm-2.7 2.6zM5.2 21H3.1v-9.9h2.1V21zm13-1H7.4v-9.4c.2-.1.3-.3.5-.4.6-.6 1.3-1.2 1.9-1.9.2-.1.3-.3.5-.5 1.4-1.6 2-3 2-4.8 0 0 0-.1.3 0 .5.1.9.5 1 1.4.3 2.1-.2 3.7-.6 4.1-.8.6-.3 1.7.7 1.7h6.2c.6 0 1.1.4 1.1.7s-.5.7-.6.7c-1.4 0-1.4 1.8-.1 2 0 .1.1.2.1.3s0 .2-.2.2c-.2.1-.4.1-.6.1-1.2 0-1.5 1.5-.4 1.9l.2.2c.2.1.2.3.2.5 0 .1-.1.1-.3.2-.2.1-.4.2-.6.2-1.1.1-1.2 1.6-.1 1.9l.1.1s.2.2.2.4c-.2.3-.4.4-.7.4z"></path></svg><span>0</span></button><button class="Buttons__linkBtn___1gAIw Buttons__btnBase___2Z659 Buttons__withIcon___3aIam" disabled="" aria-disabled="true" aria-label="Thumbs down for this answer." tabindex="-1"><svg class="Cur(p)" width="24" style="fill:#6e7780;stroke:#6e7780;stroke-width:0;vertical-align:bottom" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" data-icon="thumb-down"><path d="M1 13.1c0 1.6 1.6 2.6 3.2 2.6h4.5c-.4 1.1-.5 2.5-.3 4.1.2 1.7 1.3 2.9 2.7 3.1 1.5.2 2.8-.6 2.8-2.1-.1-1.3.4-2.2 1.5-3.5.1-.2.3-.3.4-.5.6-.6 1.2-1.2 1.8-1.7.2-.2.4-.3.6-.5H22c.6 0 1.1-.4 1.1-1V2c0-.5-.5-1-1.1-1h-4.2c-.6 0-1.1.4-1.1 1H5.9c-1.4 0-2.7.9-2.7 2.5 0 .4.1.8.2 1.1-.6.4-1 1-1 1.7 0 .4.1.8.3 1.1-.6.4-1 1-1 1.8 0 .4.1.8.2 1.1-.5.5-.9 1.1-.9 1.8zm2.7-2.6zM18.8 3h2.1v9.9h-2.1V3zm-13 1H16.6v9.4c-.2.1-.3.3-.5.4-.7.6-1.3 1.2-1.9 1.8l-.5.5c-1.4 1.6-2 3-2 4.8 0 0 0 .1-.3 0-.5-.1-.9-.5-1-1.4-.3-2.1.2-3.7.6-4.1.8-.6.3-1.7-.7-1.7H4.2c-.6 0-1.1-.4-1.1-.7s.5-.7.6-.7c1.4 0 1.4-1.8.1-2 0-.1-.1-.2-.1-.3s0-.2.2-.2c.2-.1.4-.1.6-.1 1.2.2 1.6-1.3.5-1.7l-.2-.2c-.2-.1-.3-.3-.3-.5 0-.1.1-.1.3-.2.2-.1.5-.2.6-.2 1.1-.1 1.2-1.6.1-1.9l-.1-.1s-.1-.2-.1-.4c0-.4.2-.5.5-.5z"></path></svg><span>0</span></button></div><div class="AnswerActionBar__right___nWVBY"><button class="Buttons__linkBtn___1gAIw Buttons__btnBase___2Z659 Buttons__withIcon___3aIam" disabled="" aria-disabled="true" aria-label="Report abuse." tabindex="-1"><svg class="Cur(p)" width="24" style="fill:#6e7780;stroke:#6e7780;stroke-width:0;vertical-align:bottom" height="24" viewBox="0 0 48 48" data-icon="flag"><path d="M40 10H28.62l-2.888-5-.008.004C25.38 4.407 24.74 4 24 4H8c-1.105 0-2 .896-2 2v36c0 1.105.895 2 2 2s2-.895 2-2V28h12.846l2.887 5c.357.62 1.018 1 1.732 1H40c1.105 0 2-.895 2-2V12c0-1.104-.895-2-2-2zm-2 20h-9.38l-2.888-5c-.357-.617-1.018-1-1.732-1H10V8h12.845l2.887 5c.37.642 1.04 1 1.732 1H38v16z"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></li><li><div class="Answer__answer___FdhNY"><div class="Answer__answerer___ZcKj-"><div class="UserProfile__container___1AkWy"><div class="UserProfile__profileWrapper___2XpWd" style="cursor:pointer"><div class="UserProfile__avatar___2gI-3"><a href="/activity/questions?show=YpyHuDHiaa" aria-label="Visit Cassie&#x27;s profile page."><img src="https://s.yimg.com/ag/images/default_user_profile_pic_128sq.jpg" alt="Cassie&#x27;s avatar" aria-hidden="true"/></a></div><div class="UserProfile__userInfo___PiPKv"><a class="UserProfile__userName___1d1RW" href="/activity/questions?show=YpyHuDHiaa">Cassie</a><div class="LevelBadge__levelBadge___2GjGv"><span>Lv <!-- -->5</span></div></div></div><div class="UserProfile__childrenWrapper___2A5yC"><div class="Answer__subtitle___23J6D">1 decade ago</div></div></div></div><div class="ExpandableContent__content___2Iw4v" style="max-height:120px"><p>My arab cross would do this out of the blue for no reason whatsoever, until she learned that the rope would give no matter what, and then she was fine. I&#x27;ve always tied to twine, but have noticed that blue twine doesn&#x27;t give like the other types. The twine is color coded by its strength, so if you tie to twine make sure you have the weaker yellow or orange type. Even better, is twine that is older and left out in the sun for a week or so so that it is really weak.</p><p></p><p>And of course, keep a pocket knife ready when you tie her. I wouldn&#x27;t just loop the rope through without tying it though- I have met one too many a horse that is too smart for that trick, but a quick knife job would work if your twine doesn&#x27;t break or the knot is pulled too tight.</p></div><div class="AnswerActionBar__answerActionBarWrap___bd9es"><div class="AnswerActionBar__answerActionBar___1LrM2"><div class="AnswerActionBar__left___5SkAf"><button class="Buttons__linkBtn___1gAIw Buttons__btnBase___2Z659 Buttons__withIcon___3aIam" disabled="" aria-disabled="true" aria-label="Thumbs up for this answer." tabindex="-1"><svg class="Cur(p)" width="24" style="fill:#6e7780;stroke:#6e7780;stroke-width:0;vertical-align:bottom" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" data-icon="thumb-up"><path d="M23 10.9c0-1.6-1.6-2.6-3.2-2.6h-4.5c.4-1.1.5-2.5.3-4.1-.2-1.7-1.3-2.9-2.7-3.1-1.5-.2-2.8.6-2.8 2.1.1 1.3-.4 2.2-1.5 3.5-.1 0-.2.2-.4.3-.5.6-1.2 1.2-1.8 1.7l-.5.5H2.1c-.6 0-1.1.4-1.1 1V22c0 .5.5 1 1.1 1h4.2c.6 0 1.1-.4 1.1-1h10.8c1.4 0 2.7-.9 2.7-2.5 0-.4-.1-.8-.2-1.1.6-.4 1-1 1-1.7 0-.4-.1-.8-.3-1.1.6-.4 1-1 1-1.8 0-.4-.1-.8-.2-1.1.4-.5.8-1.1.8-1.8zm-2.7 2.6zM5.2 21H3.1v-9.9h2.1V21zm13-1H7.4v-9.4c.2-.1.3-.3.5-.4.6-.6 1.3-1.2 1.9-1.9.2-.1.3-.3.5-.5 1.4-1.6 2-3 2-4.8 0 0 0-.1.3 0 .5.1.9.5 1 1.4.3 2.1-.2 3.7-.6 4.1-.8.6-.3 1.7.7 1.7h6.2c.6 0 1.1.4 1.1.7s-.5.7-.6.7c-1.4 0-1.4 1.8-.1 2 0 .1.1.2.1.3s0 .2-.2.2c-.2.1-.4.1-.6.1-1.2 0-1.5 1.5-.4 1.9l.2.2c.2.1.2.3.2.5 0 .1-.1.1-.3.2-.2.1-.4.2-.6.2-1.1.1-1.2 1.6-.1 1.9l.1.1s.2.2.2.4c-.2.3-.4.4-.7.4z"></path></svg><span>0</span></button><button class="Buttons__linkBtn___1gAIw Buttons__btnBase___2Z659 Buttons__withIcon___3aIam" disabled="" aria-disabled="true" aria-label="Thumbs down for this answer." tabindex="-1"><svg class="Cur(p)" width="24" style="fill:#6e7780;stroke:#6e7780;stroke-width:0;vertical-align:bottom" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" data-icon="thumb-down"><path d="M1 13.1c0 1.6 1.6 2.6 3.2 2.6h4.5c-.4 1.1-.5 2.5-.3 4.1.2 1.7 1.3 2.9 2.7 3.1 1.5.2 2.8-.6 2.8-2.1-.1-1.3.4-2.2 1.5-3.5.1-.2.3-.3.4-.5.6-.6 1.2-1.2 1.8-1.7.2-.2.4-.3.6-.5H22c.6 0 1.1-.4 1.1-1V2c0-.5-.5-1-1.1-1h-4.2c-.6 0-1.1.4-1.1 1H5.9c-1.4 0-2.7.9-2.7 2.5 0 .4.1.8.2 1.1-.6.4-1 1-1 1.7 0 .4.1.8.3 1.1-.6.4-1 1-1 1.8 0 .4.1.8.2 1.1-.5.5-.9 1.1-.9 1.8zm2.7-2.6zM18.8 3h2.1v9.9h-2.1V3zm-13 1H16.6v9.4c-.2.1-.3.3-.5.4-.7.6-1.3 1.2-1.9 1.8l-.5.5c-1.4 1.6-2 3-2 4.8 0 0 0 .1-.3 0-.5-.1-.9-.5-1-1.4-.3-2.1.2-3.7.6-4.1.8-.6.3-1.7-.7-1.7H4.2c-.6 0-1.1-.4-1.1-.7s.5-.7.6-.7c1.4 0 1.4-1.8.1-2 0-.1-.1-.2-.1-.3s0-.2.2-.2c.2-.1.4-.1.6-.1 1.2.2 1.6-1.3.5-1.7l-.2-.2c-.2-.1-.3-.3-.3-.5 0-.1.1-.1.3-.2.2-.1.5-.2.6-.2 1.1-.1 1.2-1.6.1-1.9l-.1-.1s-.1-.2-.1-.4c0-.4.2-.5.5-.5z"></path></svg><span>0</span></button></div><div class="AnswerActionBar__right___nWVBY"><button class="Buttons__linkBtn___1gAIw Buttons__btnBase___2Z659 Buttons__withIcon___3aIam" disabled="" aria-disabled="true" aria-label="Report abuse." tabindex="-1"><svg class="Cur(p)" width="24" style="fill:#6e7780;stroke:#6e7780;stroke-width:0;vertical-align:bottom" height="24" viewBox="0 0 48 48" data-icon="flag"><path d="M40 10H28.62l-2.888-5-.008.004C25.38 4.407 24.74 4 24 4H8c-1.105 0-2 .896-2 2v36c0 1.105.895 2 2 2s2-.895 2-2V28h12.846l2.887 5c.357.62 1.018 1 1.732 1H40c1.105 0 2-.895 2-2V12c0-1.104-.895-2-2-2zm-2 20h-9.38l-2.888-5c-.357-.617-1.018-1-1.732-1H10V8h12.845l2.887 5c.37.642 1.04 1 1.732 1H38v16z"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></li><li><div class="Answer__answer___FdhNY"><div class="Answer__answerer___ZcKj-"><div class="UserProfile__container___1AkWy"><div class="UserProfile__profileWrapper___2XpWd" style="cursor:pointer"><div class="UserProfile__avatar___2gI-3"><a href="/activity/questions?show=5EZnhspRaa" aria-label="Visit beidler&#x27;s profile page."><img src="https://s.yimg.com/ag/images/default_user_profile_pic_128sq.jpg" alt="beidler&#x27;s avatar" aria-hidden="true"/></a></div><div class="UserProfile__userInfo___PiPKv"><a class="UserProfile__userName___1d1RW" href="/activity/questions?show=5EZnhspRaa">beidler</a><div class="LevelBadge__levelBadge___2GjGv"><span>Lv <!-- -->4</span></div></div></div><div class="UserProfile__childrenWrapper___2A5yC"><div class="Answer__subtitle___23J6D">5 years ago</div></div></div></div><div class="ExpandableContent__content___2Iw4v" style="max-height:120px"><p>When a mate cheats this can be a very tramatic factor...It will also be debilitating to the devoted mate...I&#x27;d definately see a therapist and notice if you happen to are not able to &quot;repair&quot; what&#x27;s going on inside your self...When you&#x27;ll be able to triumph over the shaddow of the unjust acts performed towards you and now not task that &quot;worry&quot; onto a brand new character...then you understand you&#x27;ve got been equipped to come back to phrases with the &quot;believe problems&quot; that increase while your harm that method.

Tramatic stress disorder? Is it possible?&quot;,&quot;content&quot;:&quot;The reason why I&#x27;m asking this is I&#x27;ve started to notice a trend in my mare when it comes to tieing up.\r\nIt is like something snaps in the horse, she&#x27;s an absolute saint on the ground, you can do anything to her, but it&#x27;s like once she gets tied up she changes.\r\n\r\nWe had a little episode today when I went to hot towel her as we are going showjumping tomorrow, I had her tied up in the barn aisle - not in cross ties, but on a bit of twine. Another girl was clipping in the stables accross from me but I know this was not the reason for my mares freak out as the clippers had been going for a good half hour, plus she&#x27;s an old hand at the clippers. So I had her tied, she seemed grand, and I got the towel with warm water (it wasn&#x27;t too hot) and started to hot towel her.\r\n\r\nOnce her whole shoulder was done, she suddenly freaked, and pulled with all her might on the leadrope, which unfortunatly didn&#x27;t give. She then reared up and started to thrash, I was trying to get her untied but the quick release knot was pulled way too tight and wouldn&#x27;t give,(At this moment it&#x27;s still there, no one can untie it now) so I tried to undo the headcollar, but as she had her entire weight pulling away from it, it was near impossible. She broke the leadrope at the buckle, thank heavens (which almost broke my finger :D) and happilly trotted back to her stable. She was covered in blood from this episode which was a result from her thrashing, luckily it wasn&#x27;t too deep. She is walking fine and was calmly eating her hay not 2 minutes after this eposide.\r\n\r\nShe had an episode like this last summer &#x27;09, where the exact same happened, including breaking the leadrope (it amazes me how she is actually strong enough to this this), I was trying to hose her down after a long showjumping session at the time, she hoses fine normally.\r\n\r\nI should note that she will lead with a headcollar and leadrope brilliantly, we go for walks all the time, and she will allow you to hose her and hot towel when you&#x27;re holding the lead rope, it&#x27;s just once she&#x27;s tied she changes. I do not tie her up when grooming as I want grooming to be peaceful and calm, she will tie in a stable if necissary, but will gradually get more irritated.\r\n\r\nSo I wonder if it&#x27;s possible that she had a bad experience when tied up as a youngster, before I had her? It would make sense how such a calm horse will change once she&#x27;s tied up ... even when her best friend is right beside her she just cannot relax. The crazed look in her eyes showed that she was terrified of the situation.\r\n\r\nShe is a 15.1hh arabian mare, she&#x27;s 9 years old, I&#x27;ve had her 2 and a half years. She was only broken at 7, and her past is questionable, I cannot find any details on her before I bought her and broke her.&quot;,&quot;updatedDetails&quot;:[{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;LWxcgxNNwVAlF3xSFqjC0Jqo7Da2sqfzc1Q3ZlVN316oVAAvJAQiMgHxnrYwN6sNWmGV&quot;,&quot;createdTime&quot;:&quot;2010-10-05T15:11:28Z&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;The leadrope was tied to a bit of twine, the leadrope gave before the twing did however.\r\n\r\nI rarely tie her, I suppose stress of having to get loads of horses ready made me relapse in my judgement with tieing her, rest assured I never normally tie her when I can help it, I do not want a much worse accident to occur. \r\n\r\nI think in the whole 2 and a half years she has only been tied a few times, she&#x27;s quiet on the ground, so there was rarely any need to do it. I should note she will tie if I stand next to her all the time, she gets nervous if I were to walk away, on this occassion however, I had turned around to soak the rag I was using to how towel ....&quot;},{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;SrOmyOZNwVBJr5inOUjpfLC55gKtCSrfegD0Uv5Uk-JzYocXJ6IPvKv38E-tYYi42XDh&quot;,&quot;createdTime&quot;:&quot;2010-10-05T15:15:26Z&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Ground tieing would be a good idea - but in a country where english riding is the norm I would say it&#x27;s not a practice I have ever witnessed personally. \r\nI am from Ireland, so western riding and training is never explored here, we don&#x27;t get clinics and such, and natural horsemanship is pretty much sneered at ... sad really ...&quot;},{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;_-qJ0w5NwVDgdB54YEep8zDQ61I9aSGHjwHGevlnliVoklAAmILvCvH3T8M8Xj9vre9x&quot;,&quot;createdTime&quot;:&quot;2010-10-05T15:24:59Z&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Louise that is a great idea, It&#x27;s comforting to know that someone else had the same problem. I don&#x27;t leave her when she&#x27;s tied, she doesn&#x27;t like being on her own, so I wouldn&#x27;t take her out, tie her and then dissappear, I even avoid going to the tack room and leaving her to get grooming supplies, I just have everything ready. I will try that with just looping the leadrope through the twine, not tieing it, may give both myself and herself reassurance that no one will get hurt. I&#x27;m in Ireland myself, cross ties are quite common here!&quot;}],&quot;attachedImageUrl&quot;:null,&quot;bestAnswer&quot;:{&quot;qid&quot;:&quot;20101005145916AAfR2HS&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;qA6e1slPx1rvN_DPgBRHj-EyBJxftc06jRz21eXufFhmU2W4FA2p8CjdrERNWZrJfXDo_kCSAC77bwxW6dC-RkU=&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;I would go with she&#x27;s had some sort of incident which has freaked her. I had a tb gelding who was similar, most of the time he tied fine but every so often if he startled at something, as soon as he felt pressure on his poll he would completely freak out and thrash around till something broke. He was always tied to string but he usually broke his lead rope. He was always tied to a single point as I&#x27;m in England and most yards don&#x27;t have cross ties. The way we dealt with this was that he was never left alone tied up which made the next bit possible. Instead of tying the rope to the string we made a knot right at the end of the rope and put it through the string so there was loads hanging down with not much going from the string to the horse. Don&#x27;t tie it, just leave it through. This meant that anytime he pulled back a bit the rope slid through the string a bit so he didn&#x27;t get the tightening at the poll which is what freaked him out. You have to keep an eye on it and every time it starts to get a bit long pull it back through to shorten it again. By having the knot in the end that will stop the rope just flying through loosely but is nice and easy to release. Also try cutting half way through the string so it breaks more easily as it sounds like she reacts in a similar way. \r\nI also try to make sure they have a hay net when tied if possible although they should tie without a net for situations when you can&#x27;t have a net there such as farrier or something like that.\r\n\r\nTry to tie to a slightly higher ring than normal as they can do quite a lot of damage to their poll pulling like that but if the ring is higher there is less risk. I would also have a chiropractor or back person check her over to make sure she hasn&#x27;t hurt her poll pulling like she did.&quot;,&quot;attachedImageUrl&quot;:null,&quot;attachedImageId&quot;:null,&quot;reference&quot;:null,&quot;answerer&quot;:{&quot;euid&quot;:&quot;KdF2zkZohCLSoufvlOjQi3ZInGS8dNtpYytNZ_scBg--&quot;,&quot;kid&quot;:&quot;36612d416e7176f5335f2b3fb47cf46caa&quot;,&quot;nickname&quot;:&quot;MyNutmeg&quot;,&quot;imageUrl&quot;:&quot;https://s.yimg.com/ag/images/4598/39136182912_8857d8_128sq.jpg&quot;,&quot;level&quot;:6},&quot;isBestAnswer&quot;:true,&quot;thumbsDown&quot;:0,&quot;thumbsUp&quot;:1,&quot;isAnonymous&quot;:false,&quot;commentCount&quot;:0,&quot;createdTime&quot;:&quot;2010-10-05T15:19:09Z&quot;,&quot;userAnswerRelation&quot;:{&quot;hasFlagged&quot;:false,&quot;canFlag&quot;:true,&quot;canVote&quot;:false,&quot;canChooseBestAnswer&quot;:false,&quot;hasVoted&quot;:false,&quot;isAuthor&quot;:false,&quot;hasCommented&quot;:false,&quot;canComment&quot;:true},&quot;bestAnswerAwardTimestamp&quot;:1355070128000},&quot;isLocked&quot;:true,&quot;saveCount&quot;:0,&quot;isAnonymous&quot;:false,&quot;canChooseBestAnswer&quot;:false,&quot;userQuestionRelation&quot;:{&quot;canAnswer&quot;:true,&quot;hasAnswered&quot;:false,&quot;hasFlagged&quot;:false,&quot;hasStarred&quot;:false,&quot;isAuthor&quot;:false},&quot;saveBtnError&quot;:null,&quot;anonymousBtnError&quot;:null,&quot;updateError&quot;:null,&quot;deleteError&quot;:null,&quot;postAnswerError&quot;:null,&quot;reportAbuseError&quot;:null,&quot;setCategoryError&quot;:null,&quot;postQuestionError&quot;:null,&quot;isUpdating&quot;:false,&quot;isUpdateDone&quot;:false,&quot;isChoosingBestAnswer&quot;:false,&quot;isDeleting&quot;:false,&quot;isDeleteDone&quot;:false,&quot;isPostingAnswer&quot;:false,&quot;isPostAnswerDone&quot;:false,&quot;isSettingCategory&quot;:false,&quot;isSetCategoryDone&quot;:false,&quot;isPostingQuestion&quot;:false,&quot;isPostQuestionDone&quot;:false,&quot;categoryAssocSpaceId&quot;:2115500432,&quot;answerCount&quot;:6},&quot;extraQuestions&quot;:{&quot;keys&quot;:[],&quot;byKey&quot;:{}},&quot;questionAnswersList&quot;:{&quot;20101005145916AAfR2HS&quot;:{&quot;qid&quot;:&quot;20101005145916AAfR2HS&quot;,&quot;count&quot;:6,&quot;answerCount&quot;:6,&quot;start&quot;:1,&quot;lang&quot;:&quot;en-US&quot;,&quot;sortType&quot;:&quot;RELEVANCE&quot;,&quot;answers&quot;:[{&quot;qid&quot;:&quot;20101005145916AAfR2HS&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;4Vh7esFPx1rSoYgCJH96Z6wUt_30WKqaCs-lC1g6MLBjwc_OBsAiPBc=&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;So, you are unclear on this, has she been OK for the last 2.5 years and this is a new behavior?  She is not having a flashback all of a sudden.  Something happened to provoke this.  That said, now that you know she could do this DO NOT tie her anymore.  The next time, the both of you might not be so lucky.  You are extremely fortunate she did not flip over on you.  Another thing is to not tie her lead rope to the  post or whatever you are using.  Tie the rope with a small piece of breakable string or twine so that if she freaks, she can get free to prevent a devastating wreck.\r\n\r\nTrain her to stand ground tied.   Personally, I do not cross tie my horses. I  don&#x27;t believe in it.  I have them all trained to ground tie or tie by the lead if I am somewhere it has to be done, like a clinic or when I would have to use the tie on the side of my trailer.  I never tie my horses at home as it is not necessary.   Find out what the problem is and help her.  Please be careful.&quot;,&quot;attachedImageUrl&quot;:null,&quot;attachedImageId&quot;:null,&quot;reference&quot;:null,&quot;answerer&quot;:{&quot;euid&quot;:&quot;bZohFkh6mFRqf1zVanE3vQ7SfeIa2YV0t7W2BAMGww--&quot;,&quot;kid&quot;:&quot;EQvAbyvcaa&quot;,&quot;nickname&quot;:&quot;Barefoottrimmer&quot;,&quot;imageUrl&quot;:&quot;https://s.yimg.com/dh/ap/social/profile/profile_b48.png&quot;,&quot;level&quot;:7},&quot;isBestAnswer&quot;:false,&quot;thumbsDown&quot;:0,&quot;thumbsUp&quot;:0,&quot;isAnonymous&quot;:false,&quot;commentCount&quot;:0,&quot;createdTime&quot;:&quot;2010-10-05T15:06:43Z&quot;,&quot;userAnswerRelation&quot;:{&quot;hasFlagged&quot;:false,&quot;canFlag&quot;:true,&quot;canVote&quot;:false,&quot;canChooseBestAnswer&quot;:false,&quot;hasVoted&quot;:false,&quot;isAuthor&quot;:false,&quot;hasCommented&quot;:false,&quot;canComment&quot;:true}},{&quot;qid&quot;:&quot;20101005145916AAfR2HS&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;StXmUENPx1rJxf7gnh2gO9yBRVDXFn6X2Qgsjkb5ov_aFxqGcoe4XFo=&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;I have an idea to help her learn how to tie without actually being tied but its going to take two people for this exersize. Take her lead, and pull it through the loop (whatever you use to tie her with) and stand next to her. When she backs up and or rears or starts throwing a fit lead her in a circle and make her stand their again. Your going to use the second person to grab her and circle her when you get far enough away when she gets nervouse. Repeat everytime she moves. DO NOT tie her until you can completley move away from her for 5-10 minutes at a time. Your not actually tieing her so their won&#x27;t be a risk of injury is she escapes. But that second person can get ahold of her and turn her into a circle. She has to learn that she needs to stand until you tell her otherwise. This takes a lot of work and consistancy but she will eventually get the hint that if she just stand their she won&#x27;t have to work. Horses just hate small circles. This will also teach her to ground tie when you need her too. I&#x27;ve had to do this with my 17 H TB gelding that would do the same thing. Good luck hun and I&#x27;m glad she didn&#x27;t get hurt!  OH I love ireland! My family is irish and came from there in 1923 :) Good luck&quot;,&quot;attachedImageUrl&quot;:null,&quot;attachedImageId&quot;:null,&quot;reference&quot;:null,&quot;answerer&quot;:{&quot;euid&quot;:&quot;2rO1bcp5jyH4TmhuUP19vc5QdZg7nmlTmyitGkwtnw--&quot;,&quot;kid&quot;:&quot;qKyp1UAzaa&quot;,&quot;nickname&quot;:&quot;Teeny&quot;,&quot;imageUrl&quot;:&quot;https://s.yimg.com/ag/images/4458/38107476321_aa8074_128sq.jpg&quot;,&quot;level&quot;:3},&quot;isBestAnswer&quot;:false,&quot;thumbsDown&quot;:0,&quot;thumbsUp&quot;:0,&quot;isAnonymous&quot;:false,&quot;commentCount&quot;:0,&quot;createdTime&quot;:&quot;2010-10-05T17:02:29Z&quot;,&quot;userAnswerRelation&quot;:{&quot;hasFlagged&quot;:false,&quot;canFlag&quot;:true,&quot;canVote&quot;:false,&quot;canChooseBestAnswer&quot;:false,&quot;hasVoted&quot;:false,&quot;isAuthor&quot;:false,&quot;hasCommented&quot;:false,&quot;canComment&quot;:true}},{&quot;qid&quot;:&quot;20101005145916AAfR2HS&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;BaOYXypPx1rZ1z3UG-z5GJX5RNE4Rgn4FfTgFGx7YKGdPOBPPVXxsmc=&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;My arab cross would do this out of the blue for no reason whatsoever, until she learned that the rope would give no matter what, and then she was fine. I&#x27;ve always tied to twine, but have noticed that blue twine doesn&#x27;t give like the other types. The twine is color coded by its strength, so if you tie to twine make sure you have the weaker yellow or orange type. Even better, is twine that is older and left out in the sun for a week or so so that it is really weak.\r\n\r\nAnd of course, keep a pocket knife ready when you tie her. I wouldn&#x27;t just loop the rope through without tying it though- I have met one too many a horse that is too smart for that trick, but a quick knife job would work if your twine doesn&#x27;t break or the knot is pulled too tight.&quot;,&quot;attachedImageUrl&quot;:null,&quot;attachedImageId&quot;:null,&quot;reference&quot;:null,&quot;answerer&quot;:{&quot;euid&quot;:&quot;bhDXmW94niOBhMnzxF10_wzvv5IgDQ.kjwtEuG3_qQ--&quot;,&quot;kid&quot;:&quot;YpyHuDHiaa&quot;,&quot;nickname&quot;:&quot;Cassie&quot;,&quot;imageUrl&quot;:&quot;https://s.yimg.com/ag/images/default_user_profile_pic_128sq.jpg&quot;,&quot;level&quot;:5},&quot;isBestAnswer&quot;:false,&quot;thumbsDown&quot;:0,&quot;thumbsUp&quot;:0,&quot;isAnonymous&quot;:false,&quot;commentCount&quot;:0,&quot;createdTime&quot;:&quot;2010-10-05T15:58:45Z&quot;,&quot;userAnswerRelation&quot;:{&quot;hasFlagged&quot;:false,&quot;canFlag&quot;:true,&quot;canVote&quot;:false,&quot;canChooseBestAnswer&quot;:false,&quot;hasVoted&quot;:false,&quot;isAuthor&quot;:false,&quot;hasCommented&quot;:false,&quot;canComment&quot;:true}},{&quot;qid&quot;:&quot;20101005145916AAfR2HS&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;iGZ_SuVPx1pu5woMfvPvD9Do9joeXFuqmGoyaboJOb6r2WkQUdPTF8E=&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;When a mate cheats this can be a very tramatic factor...It will also be debilitating to the devoted mate...I&#x27;d definately see a therapist and notice if you happen to are not able to \&quot;repair\&quot; what&#x27;s going on inside your self...When you&#x27;ll be able to triumph over the shaddow of the unjust acts performed towards you and now not task that \&quot;worry\&quot; onto a brand new character...then you understand you&#x27;ve got been equipped to come back to phrases with the \&quot;believe problems\&quot; that increase while your harm that method.
