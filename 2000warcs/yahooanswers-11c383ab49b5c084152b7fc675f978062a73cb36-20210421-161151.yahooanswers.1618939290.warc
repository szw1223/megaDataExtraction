make.  However, something much more complex than the wind, say the human genetic code may require more than chance.  With its multifaceted complexity could there possibly be a cause that was purposeful?  Yes, In many christian&#39;s attempts to show you that wind has a cause and effect they are using a simplistic illustration, but where there is an effect, there is also inevitably a cause.  And If that invisible lion of yours really roared and attacked things, you, me and everyone else who saw or heard the evidence would believe, even without 100% proof.\r\n\r\nNot that subjective experience means much at all, but how could so many believer&#39;s lives be so changed for the better if there were no such thing as God?","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"The Dave"},"dateCreated":"2006-08-23T19:16:49Z","upvoteCount":0},{"@type":"Answer","text":"I might not be able to see that lion, but I would proceed with caution.  :) :)\r\n\r\nI see your frustration.  God doesn&#39;t fit in the little box you made for him, so now you are mad.  :)  \r\n\r\nYou have not seen St. Elmo&#39;s Fire.  You must choose who to believe.  The witness who saw it or the one who didn&#39;t.\r\n\r\nSo, if there really is &quot;something&quot; to God and one person &quot;sees&quot; it and another doesn&#39;t, which do you believe?  Perhaps both are telling the truth.  &quot;I saw it&quot; is as true as &quot;I saw nothing&quot; depending on the vantage point of the observers, right?\r\n\r\nWhat proof is there then?  And will I accept it?\r\n\r\nUnfortunately we haven&#39;t yet invented film that lasts 3,500 years so Moses couldn&#39;t hand us a picture of the burning bush.  but the lack of evidence is no proof.  We have the testimony.\r\n\r\nSo if testimony is the proof, we must choose.  Liar?  Lunatic?  Or Lord?\r\n\r\nThere are those who say they have seen, are they liar lunatic or did the see the Lord?\r\n\r\nThere are those whose lives were changed by what they experienced.  are they Liars?  Lunatics?  Or did they experience the Lord?\r\n\r\nWhat evidence will you accept, if not eyewitness testimony?\r\nHow would our science or even our courts work at all, if not for testimony?\r\n\r\nHow do we know of fusion of the atom?  Did you personally do it?  Did you personally observe it?  Nope.  you believe the testimony.\r\n\r\nSo if testimony is evidence, then what about results...what comes of it?  If the people who claim to have experienced God are changed, is it for better or worse?\r\n\r\nSo, are the ones who did not see accomplishing the same things that the ones who did see are accomplishing?  If not, why not?  What&#39;s the difference that comes with the knowledge that some have, and others do not?  Contemporary.  Today.  The difference is quite tangible.\r\n\r\nSo observe, hear, and choose.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Just David"},"dateCreated":"2006-08-23T19:17:20Z","upvoteCount":0},{"@type":"Answer","text":"Three reasons that the Almighty Lord Exists:\r\n\r\n1)I have the Ark of the Covenant in my basement\r\n\r\n2)The band Gamma Ray Exists\r\n\r\n3)If we all knew he didn&#39;t exist... no one would be arguing right now... hmmm somethings up.\r\n\r\nDude if this was meant to be an atheistic post, and you were a true atheist, why would you care?

However, something much more complex than the wind, say the human genetic code may require more than chance.  With its multifaceted complexity could there possibly be a cause that was purposeful?  Yes, In many christian&#x27;s attempts to show you that wind has a cause and effect they are using a simplistic illustration, but where there is an effect, there is also inevitably a cause.  And If that invisible lion of yours really roared and attacked things, you, me and everyone else who saw or heard the evidence would believe, even without 100% proof.</p><p></p><p>Not that subjective experience means much at all, but how could so many believer&#x27;s lives be so changed for the better if there were no such thing as God?</p></div><div class="AnswerActionBar__answerActionBarWrap___bd9es"><div class="AnswerActionBar__answerActionBar___1LrM2"><div class="AnswerActionBar__left___5SkAf"><button class="Buttons__linkBtn___1gAIw Buttons__btnBase___2Z659 Buttons__withIcon___3aIam" disabled="" aria-disabled="true" aria-label="Thumbs up for this answer." tabindex="-1"><svg class="Cur(p)" width="24" style="fill:#6e7780;stroke:#6e7780;stroke-width:0;vertical-align:bottom" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" data-icon="thumb-up"><path d="M23 10.9c0-1.6-1.6-2.6-3.2-2.6h-4.5c.4-1.1.5-2.5.3-4.1-.2-1.7-1.3-2.9-2.7-3.1-1.5-.2-2.8.6-2.8 2.1.1 1.3-.4 2.2-1.5 3.5-.1 0-.2.2-.4.3-.5.6-1.2 1.2-1.8 1.7l-.5.5H2.1c-.6 0-1.1.4-1.1 1V22c0 .5.5 1 1.1 1h4.2c.6 0 1.1-.4 1.1-1h10.8c1.4 0 2.7-.9 2.7-2.5 0-.4-.1-.8-.2-1.1.6-.4 1-1 1-1.7 0-.4-.1-.8-.3-1.1.6-.4 1-1 1-1.8 0-.4-.1-.8-.2-1.1.4-.5.8-1.1.8-1.8zm-2.7 2.6zM5.2 21H3.1v-9.9h2.1V21zm13-1H7.4v-9.4c.2-.1.3-.3.5-.4.6-.6 1.3-1.2 1.9-1.9.2-.1.3-.3.5-.5 1.4-1.6 2-3 2-4.8 0 0 0-.1.3 0 .5.1.9.5 1 1.4.3 2.1-.2 3.7-.6 4.1-.8.6-.3 1.7.7 1.7h6.2c.6 0 1.1.4 1.1.7s-.5.7-.6.7c-1.4 0-1.4 1.8-.1 2 0 .1.1.2.1.3s0 .2-.2.2c-.2.1-.4.1-.6.1-1.2 0-1.5 1.5-.4 1.9l.2.2c.2.1.2.3.2.5 0 .1-.1.1-.3.2-.2.1-.4.2-.6.2-1.1.1-1.2 1.6-.1 1.9l.1.1s.2.2.2.4c-.2.3-.4.4-.7.4z"></path></svg><span>0</span></button><button class="Buttons__linkBtn___1gAIw Buttons__btnBase___2Z659 Buttons__withIcon___3aIam" disabled="" aria-disabled="true" aria-label="Thumbs down for this answer." tabindex="-1"><svg class="Cur(p)" width="24" style="fill:#6e7780;stroke:#6e7780;stroke-width:0;vertical-align:bottom" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" data-icon="thumb-down"><path d="M1 13.1c0 1.6 1.6 2.6 3.2 2.6h4.5c-.4 1.1-.5 2.5-.3 4.1.2 1.7 1.3 2.9 2.7 3.1 1.5.2 2.8-.6 2.8-2.1-.1-1.3.4-2.2 1.5-3.5.1-.2.3-.3.4-.5.6-.6 1.2-1.2 1.8-1.7.2-.2.4-.3.6-.5H22c.6 0 1.1-.4 1.1-1V2c0-.5-.5-1-1.1-1h-4.2c-.6 0-1.1.4-1.1 1H5.9c-1.4 0-2.7.9-2.7 2.5 0 .4.1.8.2 1.1-.6.4-1 1-1 1.7 0 .4.1.8.3 1.1-.6.4-1 1-1 1.8 0 .4.1.8.2 1.1-.5.5-.9 1.1-.9 1.8zm2.7-2.6zM18.8 3h2.1v9.9h-2.1V3zm-13 1H16.6v9.4c-.2.1-.3.3-.5.4-.7.6-1.3 1.2-1.9 1.8l-.5.5c-1.4 1.6-2 3-2 4.8 0 0 0 .1-.3 0-.5-.1-.9-.5-1-1.4-.3-2.1.2-3.7.6-4.1.8-.6.3-1.7-.7-1.7H4.2c-.6 0-1.1-.4-1.1-.7s.5-.7.6-.7c1.4 0 1.4-1.8.1-2 0-.1-.1-.2-.1-.3s0-.2.2-.2c.2-.1.4-.1.6-.1 1.2.2 1.6-1.3.5-1.7l-.2-.2c-.2-.1-.3-.3-.3-.5 0-.1.1-.1.3-.2.2-.1.5-.2.6-.2 1.1-.1 1.2-1.6.1-1.9l-.1-.1s-.1-.2-.1-.4c0-.4.2-.5.5-.5z"></path></svg><span>0</span></button></div><div class="AnswerActionBar__right___nWVBY"><button class="Buttons__linkBtn___1gAIw Buttons__btnBase___2Z659 Buttons__withIcon___3aIam" disabled="" aria-disabled="true" aria-label="Report abuse." tabindex="-1"><svg class="Cur(p)" width="24" style="fill:#6e7780;stroke:#6e7780;stroke-width:0;vertical-align:bottom" height="24" viewBox="0 0 48 48" data-icon="flag"><path d="M40 10H28.62l-2.888-5-.008.004C25.38 4.407 24.74 4 24 4H8c-1.105 0-2 .896-2 2v36c0 1.105.895 2 2 2s2-.895 2-2V28h12.846l2.887 5c.357.62 1.018 1 1.732 1H40c1.105 0 2-.895 2-2V12c0-1.104-.895-2-2-2zm-2 20h-9.38l-2.888-5c-.357-.617-1.018-1-1.732-1H10V8h12.845l2.887 5c.37.642 1.04 1 1.732 1H38v16z"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></li><li><div class="Answer__answer___FdhNY"><div class="Answer__answerer___ZcKj-"><div class="UserProfile__container___1AkWy"><div class="UserProfile__profileWrapper___2XpWd" style="cursor:pointer"><div class="UserProfile__avatar___2gI-3"><a href="/activity/questions?show=f6604538e6501b1965037706555f861eaa" aria-label="Visit Just David&#x27;s profile page."><img src="https://s.yimg.com/dh/ap/social/profile/profile_b48.png" alt="Just David&#x27;s avatar" aria-hidden="true"/></a></div><div class="UserProfile__userInfo___PiPKv"><a class="UserProfile__userName___1d1RW" href="/activity/questions?show=f6604538e6501b1965037706555f861eaa">Just David</a><div class="LevelBadge__levelBadge___2GjGv"><span>Lv <!-- -->5</span></div></div></div><div class="UserProfile__childrenWrapper___2A5yC"><div class="Answer__subtitle___23J6D">1 decade ago</div></div></div></div><div class="ExpandableContent__content___2Iw4v" style="max-height:120px"><p>I might not be able to see that lion, but I would proceed with caution.  :) :)</p><p></p><p>I see your frustration.

interesting point that you make.  However, something much more complex than the wind, say the human genetic code may require more than chance.  With its multifaceted complexity could there possibly be a cause that was purposeful?  Yes, In many christian&#x27;s attempts to show you that wind has a cause and effect they are using a simplistic illustration, but where there is an effect, there is also inevitably a cause.  And If that invisible lion of yours really roared and attacked things, you, me and everyone else who saw or heard the evidence would believe, even without 100% proof.\r\n\r\nNot that subjective experience means much at all, but how could so many believer&#x27;s lives be so changed for the better if there were no such thing as God?&quot;,&quot;attachedImageUrl&quot;:null,&quot;attachedImageId&quot;:null,&quot;reference&quot;:null,&quot;answerer&quot;:{&quot;euid&quot;:&quot;44t_Qe0I_l4XbGJPTaQd8SqoFThuIgh2YYaAV9wM3g--&quot;,&quot;kid&quot;:&quot;43de480a42b50a0d24d34f724449a057aa&quot;,&quot;nickname&quot;:&quot;The Dave&quot;,&quot;imageUrl&quot;:&quot;https://s.yimg.com/ag/images/1776/56195490164_97212c_128sq.jpg&quot;,&quot;level&quot;:2},&quot;isBestAnswer&quot;:false,&quot;thumbsDown&quot;:0,&quot;thumbsUp&quot;:0,&quot;isAnonymous&quot;:false,&quot;commentCount&quot;:0,&quot;createdTime&quot;:&quot;2006-08-23T19:16:49Z&quot;,&quot;userAnswerRelation&quot;:{&quot;hasFlagged&quot;:false,&quot;canFlag&quot;:true,&quot;canVote&quot;:false,&quot;canChooseBestAnswer&quot;:false,&quot;hasVoted&quot;:false,&quot;isAuthor&quot;:false,&quot;hasCommented&quot;:false,&quot;canComment&quot;:true}},{&quot;qid&quot;:&quot;20060823120110AAJf2WM&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;uZROx-VPx1pujdL3kcMPl2FDb_DjX_wX-UW4dBGbqxlxKTYTPN5HpdK0DAXCzPV2yAtRdl4PYQ8Z78nCxzli8Vk=&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;I might not be able to see that lion, but I would proceed with caution.  :) :)\r\n\r\nI see your frustration.  God doesn&#x27;t fit in the little box you made for him, so now you are mad.  :)  \r\n\r\nYou have not seen St. Elmo&#x27;s Fire.  You must choose who to believe.  The witness who saw it or the one who didn&#x27;t.\r\n\r\nSo, if there really is \&quot;something\&quot; to God and one person \&quot;sees\&quot; it and another doesn&#x27;t, which do you believe?  Perhaps both are telling the truth.  \&quot;I saw it\&quot; is as true as \&quot;I saw nothing\&quot; depending on the vantage point of the observers, right?\r\n\r\nWhat proof is there then?  And will I accept it?\r\n\r\nUnfortunately we haven&#x27;t yet invented film that lasts 3,500 years so Moses couldn&#x27;t hand us a picture of the burning bush.  but the lack of evidence is no proof.  We have the testimony.\r\n\r\nSo if testimony is the proof, we must choose.  Liar?  Lunatic?  Or Lord?\r\n\r\nThere are those who say they have seen, are they liar lunatic or did the see the Lord?\r\n\r\nThere are those whose lives were changed by what they experienced.  are they Liars?  Lunatics?  Or did they experience the Lord?\r\n\r\nWhat evidence will you accept, if not eyewitness testimony?\r\nHow would our science or even our courts work at all, if not for testimony?\r\n\r\nHow do we know of fusion of the atom?  Did you personally do it?  Did you personally observe it?  Nope.  you believe the testimony.\r\n\r\nSo if testimony is evidence, then what about results...what comes of it?  If the people who claim to have experienced God are changed, is it for better or worse?\r\n\r\nSo, are the ones who did not see accomplishing the same things that the ones who did see are accomplishing?  If not, why not?  What&#x27;s the difference that comes with the knowledge that some have, and others do not?  Contemporary.  Today.  The difference is quite tangible.\r\n\r\nSo observe, hear, and choose.&quot;,&quot;attachedImageUrl&quot;:null,&quot;attachedImageId&quot;:null,&quot;reference&quot;:null,&quot;answerer&quot;:{&quot;euid&quot;:&quot;Spu8TnhlmkIt_wOWBTWq3Dy4hlm0j.XCs0bVXuwk4Q--&quot;,&quot;kid&quot;:&quot;f6604538e6501b1965037706555f861eaa&quot;,&quot;nickname&quot;:&quot;Just David&quot;,&quot;imageUrl&quot;:&quot;https://s.yimg.com/dh/ap/social/profile/profile_b48.png&quot;,&quot;level&quot;:5},&quot;isBestAnswer&quot;:false,&quot;thumbsDown&quot;:0,&quot;thumbsUp&quot;:0,&quot;isAnonymous&quot;:false,&quot;commentCount&quot;:0,&quot;createdTime&quot;:&quot;2006-08-23T19:17:20Z&quot;,&quot;userAnswerRelation&quot;:{&quot;hasFlagged&quot;:false,&quot;canFlag&quot;:true,&quot;canVote&quot;:false,&quot;canChooseBestAnswer&quot;:false,&quot;hasVoted&quot;:false,&quot;isAuthor&quot;:false,&quot;hasCommented&quot;:false,&quot;canComment&quot;:true}},{&quot;qid&quot;:&quot;20060823120110AAJf2WM&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;Kp12FJ1Px1reYZ3jCSBL7AoEF7lrMt28RPTdD1JHam8QP-xbr_VDMnU=&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Three reasons that the Almighty Lord Exists:\r\n\r\n1)I have the Ark of the Covenant in my basement\r\n\r\n2)The band Gamma Ray Exists\r\n\r\n3)If we all knew he didn&#x27;t exist... no one would be arguing right now... hmmm somethings up.\r\n\r\nDude if this was meant to be an atheistic post, and you were a true atheist, why would you care?

You can not expect to know God by aimlessly wandering about.

If the people who claim to have experienced God are changed, is it for better or worse?\r\n\r\nSo, are the ones who did not see accomplishing the same things that the ones who did see are accomplishing?
