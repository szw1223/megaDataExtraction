Take them long enough, and your body will get used to the meds, and the pain may not go away. That could be why your meds are only working for 6 months.\r\nI have been off work for 2 years because of migraines and a migraine related stroke, but have suffered migraines since I was a child. I have tried every medication imaginable, and up until November &#39;05 was on a Duragesic 100 patch (this medication was 80x more powerful than morphine, and in the end still was not doing the trick). I have been in the ER still suffering after receiving over 300cc&#39;s of Demerol, and thought nothing would ever help.\r\nI went to a new Neurologist who told me to get off of the analgesics, be it Tylenol, Ibuprofen, or Rx drugs. He also took me off of Ametriptaline and Serataline.\r\nIt was hell when I did get a migraine, as I couldn&#39;t take anything, and had to &quot;suffer through the pain&quot;, but I have been headache free for the past month. I know that doesn&#39;t seem long, but I can&#39;t remember the last time I&#39;ve gone this long without pain.", "author_link": "not found", "author_name": "Duncarin", "best": "true", "dislikes": "0", "likes": 1, "timestamp": "2006-07-16T23:53:55Z"}], "authorInfor": "none", "last_updata_data": "now"}
